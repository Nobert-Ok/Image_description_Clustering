39,Tools & Home Improvement,Freud LU92M008 8-Inch 48 Tooth MTCG Laminate Cutting Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch Arbor,"The 8-inch Freud LU92M008 Thick Stock Laminate Cutting Saw Blade is a heavy-duty production blade designed to make smooth, chip-free cuts when working with thick laminates and melamine. It features a modified, application-specific, triple-chip tooth grind, the long-term dependability of TiCo high-density carbide, and the anti-friction performance of Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating.LU92M008 Thick Stock Laminate Cutting Saw BladeAt a Glance:Ideal for single- and double-sided laminates, melamine, and stacks of 3/4-inch manmade materialsHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsSilver I.C.E. coating reduces friction and prevents gummingTechnical Specs:CoatingSilver ICEDiameter8""Teeth48 MTCGArbor5/8""Kerf (K).126Plate (P).087Depth of CutModified Triple Chip Grind (MTCG) Tooth Designfor long life and chipfree cuts in thick stock manmade materialsNegative Hook Angleminimizes chipping in laminates and melamineSpecial Grind and Negative Hook Angle for Chip-Free LaminatesBuilt to leave a high-quality, chip-free finish on both the top and the bottom of thick laminates and melamine, this blade features 48 teeth with a special, modified triple-chip grind. Based on the results of extensive computer simulations, this grind is ideally suited to working with thick stock and stacks of single- or double-sided laminates. The blade's teeth also feature 6-degree, negative hook angles, which helps prevent the blade from being too aggressive and further reduces the possibility of chipping.This blade is designed for optimal performance when cutting stacks of 3/4-inch laminates and melamine, and it's also an excellent performer in plywood and chipboard. This blade can also crosscut or rip wood, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis thick-stock saw blade's 48 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""laminate blend."" Formulated to extend tooth life in the face of work with laminates, melamine, and solid surfaces, this blend is extra hard--due to the proportion of high-density tungsten carbide that goes into it--and it still offers the mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin BuildupThis blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or ""pitch"" buildup.Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

196,Tools & Home Improvement,Bosch 1584AVSK Barrel Grip Jig Saw with Case,"This is the barrel-grip version of Bosch's bestselling top-handle 1587 model. Many woodworkers prefer the barrel grip on this model, however, arguing that it's easier to cut scrolls and curves when the saw is pushed forward (as opposed to down). Aside from the difference in grip, this saw is much like its top-handle counterpart: the balance is superb, the 5 amp motor packs plenty of power, the foot plate tilts left and right (up to 45 degrees), and the base retracts for flush cutting. The tool-free blade-changing system also works well. Simply put, this a compact, powerful, well-designed saw--a perfect buy for users who prefer barrel grips.--Jon Groebner"

Listeners can match it with a second speaker to create a stereo setup, or they can install it in a secondary room, such as a bedroom, office, or kitchen, and enjoy remote sound from the main amplifier. Installation is relatively straightforward thanks to the EZ mounting tabs along the perimeter: merely cut a 9.38-inch hole in the ceiling while preserving enough room for the speaker's 3.25-inch mounting depth, and then fold the tabs over the cutout. The speaker's white faceplate is even designed to blend easily with most ceiling surfaces.Once installed, the speaker employs its 8-inch polypropylene cone woofer and 1-inch hard dome tweeter to produce a frequency response of 70 Hz to 20 kHz. To ensure a more flexible audio performance, Speco fixed the tweeter on a pivot, allowing users to adjust the high-frequency listening angle. The pivot helps the SP-8C overcome the rigidity native to many in-ceiling and in-wall speakers. Each time you rearrange the furniture to create a new listening environment, simply rotate the tweeter toward the new area. The high frequencies will thus continue to sound full and crisp, rather than muffled or distant.Other tech specs include 30 watts of RMS power (50 watts max), 8 ohms of impedance, and a crossover frequency of 2.5 kHz. The speaker measures 10.75 inches in diameter and weighs a mere 4 pounds.What's in the BoxSP-8C in-ceiling speaker, mounting hardware, user's manual."

Reconditioned generally means that the tool has been returned to the manufacturer, who brings the tool back to like new condition. Some tools may contain cosmetic blemishes.Whether at home, in the basement, or at a remodeling site, DeWalt's 5.8 amp jig saw makes cutouts the way they should be: quick and hassle-free. Vibration-dampening rubber grips soak up the shocks, making it easier to hold the line, and the counterbalance design places the weight squarely over the shoe. Need a fast cut? Flip the orbital adjustment switch to position four (maximum swing) and cruise through material at up to 3,100-inch-long strokes per minute. For more precise cuts in high-visibility areas, use the zero setting (orbitless motion) for a cleaner edge. Thanks to an adjustable blower on the right side, sawdust is whisked out of the line of sight, a feature we always appreciate in a jig saw. The shoe locks on this saw seem sturdier than the one on DeWalt's cordless model and the shoe easily adjusts--with a tool-free lever--to slide forward or backward for flush cutting, and also bevels 45 degrees to both sides. No wrenches are required to change blades, either: simply pull and turn the top, remove the old blade, and replace it with the desired universal or T-shank--a handy, timesaving design that is unique to DeWalt. --Justin Paul"

And, the saws are designed to cut at a reduced feed pressure, meaning you don&#x92;t have to muscle-up and force the saw through the work piece. The kit also includes three pilot bits and two arbors. All of the pieces fit neatly into a plastic storage case.Milwaukee 49-22-4086 17-Piece Electrician&#x92;s Hole Saw Kit was created for professional electricians, but it would be valuable to plumbers, HVAC installers, sheet metal workers, and serious DIYers. The hole saws can be used to cut through a wide variety of building materials, including steel, aluminum, metal studs, copper, galvanized flashing, brass, sheet metal, stainless steel, wood, plywood, particleboard, oriented-strand board, asphalt shingles, and all kinds of plastic.--Joseph TruiniWhat&#x92;s in the Box:17-piece hole saw kit, Twelve hole saws, Three pilot bits, Two arbors, Plastic storage case"

1012,Tools & Home Improvement,Hitachi M12-volts 3-1/4-Horsepower Electronic Variable Speed 1/2-inch Plunge Router,"Routers don't get any bigger and tougher than this Hitachi workhorse. It has the solid construction, horsepower, and features we've come to expect in a top-of-the-line router. Its heft goes a long way toward eliminating vibration, working with the soft-start motor to cut out torque at startup. Despite its nearly 12 pounds, it actually handles as well as most 3-1/4-horsepower routers we've tried in freehand applications. It has a 1/2-inch collet and a wide sub-base opening, making it suitable for working with all but the very biggest panel bits. It features electronic variable speed, so the router makes clean cuts in a wide range of different materials. We found the controls to be within easy reach of the handles, and though this isn't the quietest router we've used, it comes pretty close. We like the unique eight-position handles that let the tool be adjusted to the worker rather than the other way around. While this is a topnotch plunge router, it's also an excellent choice for table mounting, and many people choose this model for exactly that reason. This is an all-around solid tool that offers more bang per buck than many competing models.--Brian Trinen"

1426,Tools & Home Improvement,Freud LU84R012 12-Inch 60 Tooth ATB Combination Saw Blade with 1-Inch Arbor and PermaShield Coating,"The 12-inch Freud LU84R012 Combination Saw Blade with Perma-SHIELD offers a configuration that pairs flat teeth and alternating-top-bevel teeth to ensure strong performance both when ripping and when crosscutting. Also offering TiCo high-density carbide tips, laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that eliminate the need for stabilizers, and Freud's Perma-SHIELD coating to prevent the buildup of friction and heat, this multi-purpose blade is built for lasting convenience.LU84R012 Combination Saw Blade with Perma-SHIELDAt a Glance:Ideal for crosscutting materials 3/4 to 3-1/2inches thick, and ripping materials 3/8 to 1-1/2 inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-SHIELD coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter12""Teeth60 COMBArbor1""Kerf (K).126Plate (P).087Large Gulletsallow for fast ripping and easy chip removalLaser-Cut Anti-Vibration Slotsdrastically reduce vibration and sideways movement in the cut extending blade life, and giving a crisp, swirl-free flawless finishCombination Tooth Design for Versatility and AccuracyThis blade's 60 teeth are arranged in groups of five, each of which includes one flat-top raker tooth for fast, accurate ripping. Each flat tooth is followed by four alternating-top-bevel (ATB) teeth that are particularly well suited to crosscutting, and large gullets between the teeth ensure effective chip clearance.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting materials that are 3/4 to 3-1/2 inches thick or ripping materials that are 3/8 to 1-1/2 inches thick. It makes quick work of hard- and softwood, plywood, and chipboard. It can also handle laminates or tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis combination saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""combination blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge for longer when faced with a variety of applications, this blend includes just a little bit more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends. And it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

But the Luxus's non-contact, non-vacuum cutting system produces a beautiful, scissor-cut and rolled look without jeopardizing the roots, so you get ultra-green, super healthy, plush results, every time.More great features: The cut-height adjusts from .5- to 1.8-inches for a wide variety of mowing applications. An extra rigid handle means optimal power and control. A large metal top-cover protects overhanging flowers and shrubs as the Luxus passes by.

2343,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",Weber 2003 Model 3390001 Genesis Gold C Natural Gas Grill (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"At first glance, Weber gas grills look like something that might be shot into space or driven in a Formula 1 race rather than the sleek cooking machines they really are. This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis series of grills, Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on your patio. The Genesis Gold C features a generous 611 square inches of total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000 Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting fuel. The Genesis Gold C also features a side burner, rated at 10,000 Btu's per hour, that is perfect for creating a side dish to accompany your perfectly cooked main course. In place of the lava rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber grills feature the company's patented Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats.  Instead, juices sizzle and smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast.Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's  Crossover ignition system enables you to effortlessly start all three burners,  which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer  included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the  double-walled stainless-steel hood; it can also be removed and used as a meat  thermometer to ensure a thoroughly cooked meal every time. And you won't need to  scramble for seasonings (or recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a  separate table while cooking, thanks to several convenient features. In addition  to the handy work surface on one side of the unit, a wire condiment basket hangs  along the front of the grill, keeping condiments, spices, marinades, or other  barbecue necessities close at hand. A wire shelf is situated beneath the grill  and stretches the length of the unit, and three wire tool hooks hang below the  work surface, ready for your spatula, meat fork, and basting brush. Weber  natural gas grills also come with a 12-foot quick-disconnect hose.With its lid open, the Genesis Gold C measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2 inches  wide, and 33 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved,  however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which  prevent it from moving when you're cooking. While a grill cover is recommended  to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor  storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special  spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or  nests.This grill features Weber's Stop Watch engineering. Now it takes approximately  10 minutes to assemble your grill with no more than eight fasteners and a single  tool. Weber even throws in the tool.

Featuring 64 teeth with alternating bevels and TiCo high-density carbide tips, a unique side-grind setup that polishes material as you cut through it, and Freud's insulating, Perma-SHIELD coating, this blade is built to deliver top results over the long haul.LU85R008 Ultimate Cut-Off Saw BladeAt a Glance:Ideal for smooth crosscuts in materials that are 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-Shield coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter8""Teeth64 ATBArbor5/8""Kerf (K).116Plate (P).098Depth of CutUnique Side Grindpolishes the material to produce a superior finishLaser-Cut Anti-Vibration Slotsdrastically reduce vibration and sideways movement in the cut extending blade life, and giving a crisp, flawless finishATB Teeth with Side-Grinding for Glass-Smooth FinishesThis cut-off blade's 64-tooth alternating-top-bevel (ATB) configuration features teeth that face both left and right--a versatile setup that's ideal for crosscuts in hard- and softwood, as well as general use. And thanks to the unique side-grind on each tooth, the blade smoothes work surfaces as it cuts through them. This leaves you with a super-smooth, high-quality finish that doesn't need to be sanded down.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting wood that is 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches thick, or when cutting chipboard and plywood that is less than 1-inch thick. The blade can also handle ripping wood and working with laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.116 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis cut-off saw blade's 64 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""crosscut blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

Heavy-duty  cast-iron trunnions support the sealed ball-bearings' blade arbor  housing for a smooth performance with minimal vibration. JET also uses  totally enclosed fan-cooled motors, preventing overheating and dust  infiltration and resulting in longer motor life and less risk of a fire  hazard than with open motor housing. The stand for this saw is made of  a tougher-gauge metal and has a 4-inch dust port for easy connection to  a dust collector. Another user-friendly feature is the quick-connect  electrical plug right at the saw, meaning you don't have to search out  the wall socket prior to every blade change. JET has also located the  on/off switch at the top left for easy access when a quick shutdown is  required. A change in the hole pattern on the fence rails means lefties  can now shift the set to their preferences. The fit, finish, and use of  a more durable powder coating instead of paint will make a proud owner  of every user--from the beginner who wants to learn with confidence to  the seasoned pro who doesn't have space for a full-size cabinet saw.--Nancy Gleason"

2673,Tools & Home Improvement,"Powermatic 1660802K Model 66 Special Edition 10-Inch Left Tilt 3-Horsepower Cabinet Saw with 30-Inch Accu-Fence, 1 Cast Iron Extension Wing, and Table Board, 230-Volt 1-Phase","If you've always wanted to own Powermatic's model 66 table saw, but you've held off because of the space it demands, then take a close look at Powermatic's Special Edition 66, built with the home workshop in mind. This is a piece of shop equipment that makes a toolhound's heart beat faster. The eye-catching high-grade cast-iron top is machine-polished to a mirror finish. The saw's table--impressively thick and durable--has both a cast-iron wing extension and a laminated extension (total surface: 28 by 53-3/4 inches). With one of the heaviest cast-iron trunnions on any 10-inch saw on the market, the model 66 virtually snuffs out vibration. The double drive-belt system--hooked up to the burly 3-horsepower motor--delivers pretty astonishing power. A C-flange mount takes the weight of the motor, so the blade cranks up or down easily without the extra weight. The saw's hand wheels are also made of cast iron and have excellent clearance.The heart of any table saw, arguably, is the fence--and Powermatic's Special Edition 66 sports the award-winning Accu-Fence, a system that uses only two moving parts to create easy-gliding, precision, no-budge fence action. The left-tilting blade tilts away from the fence, which helps prevent kickback and binding of the stock, making for smoother cuts. The two-sided blade guards work independently of each other, so the blade is always covered. The guards also swing totally out of the way to make blade changes easy. Behind the blade, there are antikickback pawls for added safety. The saw's base has a clean-out door, allowing you easy access to the saw body and making cleanup a snap--no reaching around the saw components or having to remove the motor cover. You'll also receive a load of extras, including a dado insert, a motor cover, and an extension table and legs. Admittedly, this isn't a cheap saw; without a doubt, however, it is an excellent one that would make a great addition to any shop. As with almost everything, you get what you pay for--in the case of Powermatic's Special Edition 66, you get a fantastic piece of equipment your friends will envy.--Jon Groebner"

The Estate Trellis provides an attractive barrier between a garden's splendor and more industrial eyesights while supporting vines and bushes, such as ivy, morning glories, or roses. The trellis may be placed against a wall or fence, or it can stand alone.With PVC construction, the trellis resists weather-inflicted damage. While wood may rot and metals rust from continual rain exposure, the vinyl composition stops cracks, chips, peeling, and rot for years of use. Duratrel used titanium dioxide with a UV stabilizer to finish the trellis to prevent yellowing or fading in the sunlight, maintaining its white fa&#xE7;ade. Two 2-by-inch square legs extend to form the exterior beams of the fan design. Ground anchors hold the legs firmly to the ground. The interior features a grid structure of 1-by-1-inch vertical beams intersected by 4/5-by-1-1/2-inch horizontal rails, designed specifically for upward growth. All trellis pieces come prefabricated for quick and simple assembly. Instructions, hardware, and a wall-mounting kit are included for further ease. To clean the trellis, use biodegradable soap and water. A 20-year warranty is available for this item, though painting the trellis voids this offer.

Other ceiling fans may claim efficiency with low-wattage motors, but they move little air. Competitors also compromise on blade pitch and blade surface area, which makes a fan even less efficient. Thankfully, this Hunter ceiling fan harmonizes precision craftwork with a one-of-a-kind motor for optimum heat displacement and air movement.Exclusive WhisperWind MotorThe WhisperWind motor found in the Beacon Hill Ceiling Fan delivers ultra-powerful air movement with whisper-quiet performance, so you get the cooling power you want--without the noise you don't.Like all Hunter motors, the WhisperWind motor features copper wiring that has a balanced temperature rise in each winding. This eliminates hot spots for increased motor reliability and longevity. Additionally, the motor utilizes precision-engineered large and small ball bearings that provide minimal resistance and friction for virtually noise-free operation. For even greater efficiency, the motor features an internal impeller that facilitates air circulation to keep the motor cool and ensure long life.Combined, these exclusive Hunter motor technologies result in 15&#37; improved performance, 20&#37; longer life, 20&#37; less noise, and up to 47&#37; savings on cooling costs.Savings Without SacrificeLike all Hunter ceiling fans, the Beacon Hill can save you up to 47&#37; on cooling costs. To put this in perspective, the wind chill from a Hunter ceiling fan will keep you as cool at 82 degrees as you would be at 76 degrees without a ceiling fan. That means you could set your thermostat 6 degrees higher and cut your energy bill almost in half--without sacrificing comfort. Use the Beacon Hill during the summer months to keep cool, or run it clockwise during the winter to circulate warm air.Durable Fan is Easy to Install and OperateThe Beacon Hill comes with an Installer's Choice three-position mounting system, so you can hang the fan in a standard, flush, or angled position. It can be installed with or without its 180-watt three-light fixture, which uses three 60-watt candelabra bulbs (included). A standard three-speed pull chain allows for quick and easy adjustments.Built to last, the Beacon Hill is backed by Hunter's famous Limited Lifetime Motor Warranty.About Hunter: Building the Best Since 1886Long before the widespread use of electricity, people around the world counted on Hunter ceiling fans for cool comfort.

This is your go-to set for efficiently creating dadoes and grooves in a wide range of materials from hardwood to laminate. Boasting thick MicroGrain carbide tips and an anti-kickback design, the set's two outside blades can be resharpened for long-term accuracy. For added versatility, the kit cuts grooves spanning 1/4 to 7/8 inch and includes a shim set.Resharpening Blades for Smooth, Splinter-Free DadoesThe perfect dado set for the fine cabinetmaker or weekend woodworker, the Freud SD206 produces dadoes and grooves that meet with flush, even edges. So you can be assured of precise cuts every time, the set is equipped with precision-grade features, starting with two proprietary outside blades that can be resharpened to deliver accuracy for the long term.These high-quality six-inch, 10-tooth blades with 5/8-inch arbors cut dadoes and grooves that are clean, flat, and virtually splinter free. Cuts made by these blades are accurate the first time, saving you from making repeated passes over the same workpiece.Flexibility for Cutting Hardwoods, Laminates, and MoreThe Freud SD206 accommodates a wide range of materials, so you can use it from project to project. And because it requires less power to feed, it is ideal for use with underpowered saws. Use it to create dadoes and grooves in hardwood, softwood, chip board, plywood, and laminate (not recommended for non-ferrous materials).Two-Wing Chippers and Shim Set for Fine AdjustmentsThe set includes three 1/8-inch chippers and three 1/16-inch spacers to save you time and energy. With their two-wing design, the chippers efficiently remove waste material and smooth the edges of your workpiece. Plus, they allow you to fine-tune your cuts from 1/4 to 7/8 inch, so you have accurate control over the desired width.And with the Freud SD206's included shim set, you never have to give up making dadoes with a workpiece that's too thin to fit the width of your dado blades. This handy shim set expands the range of your kerf adjustments, giving you even greater control for achieving a flawless finished workpiece.Anti-Kickback Design for Safe OperationThe quality of this dado set is enhanced by its anti-kickback design, which gives you an added margin of safety while you work.MicroGrain Carbide Tips for Long-Lasting PerformanceSo you can get maximum performance out of this set, the blade components are constructed with Freud's TiCo Hi-Density Carbide. This means the blades can withstand numerous sharpenings and still retain their precision. And a Tri-metal Brazing process gives the blades impact resistance, so they last for the long term without dulling (a condition that can cause torn wood and uneven cuts).About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

4659,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 6266-21 Fast Cutting Top Handle Orbital Jig Saw with Case,"This professional-quality tool has all the features users have  come to expect in a jig saw, and all the power and reliability for  which Milwaukee is known. The saw's variable-speed 5.7 amp motor is  capable of cutting tight, smooth curves through a wide range of  materials. The saw also features electronic speed control and four  levels of orbital action, from no orbit for metal cutting all the way  up to a heavy-orbit setting for working with soft woods. The tool-free  blade changing system on this saw is one of the quickest and easiest  we've tried, involving nothing more than pulling the lever on the front  of the tool, dropping the old blade out, and putting a new blade in--no  tricky pinching or twisting. A roller guide provides constant blade  stability in tight corners, and helps make alignment easy during blade  changes. The shoe bevels 45 degrees in either direction, and although  it does require a hex wrench for adjustments, the wrench stores handily  in a clip in the shoe. We like the lockable trigger on this jig saw,  too. It's large enough that you can pull it with two or three fingers,  which really reduces hand fatigue. We also appreciated the finger guard  that extends all the way down to the shoe on the front of the saw--a  nice safety feature.

Powermatic's 64 left-tilt saw has a precision-ground cast-iron table with a beveled front edge, rather than a 90-degree edge, to eliminate the risk of damaging material. The solid cast-iron extensions expand the saw's work surface, as well as minimize vibration. The blade tilts to the left, away from the fence--that prevents binding and reduces the risk of kickback (we highly recommend left-tilting saws). Powermatic has also developed its Accufence system with an extra-large cam that clamps the fence securely in place--fences with smaller cam locks don't hold nearly so well. The fence's particleboard sides are also easily and cheaply replaced (unlike an entire fence) if they get cut up during use. There's an integral dust shroud and a 4-inch port, so you can hook the saw up to a dust collector. The blade guard adjusts independently on each side and has a standard kickback paw on the end. The safety switch is removable; just pull it off to prevent unauthorized use (but keep an eye on it; it's small and could be easily misplaced).Although the saw is quite heavy, it is still portable enough to be loaded in the back of a truck for transport to a job site. The saw's longer rails allow cutting 50 inches to the right and 12 inches to the left of the saw blade when used with the optional table and leg set. With well-thought-out features and rugged construction, this model is a solid choice for those needing a contractor-grade saw and a premium choice for the craftsperson or home hobbyist looking for durability and professional features.--Tim Block"

Many woodworkers prefer the barrel grip on this model, however, arguing that it's easier to cut scrolls and curves when the saw is pushed forward (as opposed to down). Aside from the difference in grip, this saw is much like its top-handle counterpart: the balance is superb, the 5 amp motor packs plenty of power, the foot plate tilts left and right (up to 45 degrees), and the base retracts for flush cutting. The tool-free blade-changing system also works well. Simply put, this a compact, powerful, well-designed saw--a perfect buy for users who prefer barrel grips.--Jon Groebner"

In his lifetime, Mr. Dremel owned 55 patents on a wide range of products from electric erasers to a gas-powered rotary lawn mower. His most famous and important invention was a high-speed rotary tool, dubbed the Dremel Moto-Tool. Compact, lightweight, and perfect for a wide range of jobs, the rotary tool was an immediate hit with hobbyists and eventually became accepted as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. Today, the Dremel name remains synonymous with utility, durability, and innovation.What's in the BoxFlex attachment, square drive nut, and instruction booklet"

Hex drive systems are driven with a wrench.Stainless steels are used for their corrosion resistance, high-temperature strength, scaling resistance, and low-temperature toughness.&#xA0; These properties account for their extremely wide use in practically every industry.  Austenitic Stainless Steels are alloys of iron and carbon that contain between 16% and 30% Chromium, a maximum of 0.15% carbon, along with Nickel (or Manganese), and other alloying elements.&#xA0; The chromium, which helps develop a passive surface oxide film, provides corrosion resistance in stainless steels.&#xA0;&#xA0; Austenitic Stainless Steels are designated by a 3 digit SAE Stainless Steel Grade beginning with the number 3 (e.g. 304, 316).&#xA0; Another common naming convention for Austenitic Stainless Steels are 18/8, 18/10, 18/0, etc. where the 18 refers to the % of Chromium and 8 to the % of Nickel contained in the material.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Coarse threads are better when working with brittle materials; they are sturdier and are easier to thread and unthread compared to fine.

These  powerful saws make angled cuts by pulling a circular blade down onto a workpiece with a short,  controlled plunge. It might appear that miter saws are infinitely complex and varied, but there  are only three general types. The type you choose will depend on your woodworking needs.Basic Miter SawsBasic miter saws are the least versatile off the three major variations, but they&#x92;re a great  starting point for novice do-it-yourselfers. These models typically adjust for miter cuts only,  so consider upgrading if you need to do more than that.Compound Miter SawCompound miter saws are easier to use than basic miter saws because you can place your stock  flat for cutting, and they adjust simultaneously for miter and bevel cuts. A compound miter saw  is great for jobs that feature stock that's not very tall or wide, such as door and window trim  or picture frames.Sliding Compound Miter SawsSliding compound miter saws are the most versatile of the available models. They have a motor  and blade assembly that's mounted on a moveable arm to accommodate longer, wider workpieces. For  smaller pieces, the saw performs like an ordinary fixed-head model. On some models, the blade  can only pivot in one direction, but on adualsliding compound miter saw, the blade can  tilt to the right or left.Important Features at a GlanceThough models will vary by manufacturer and design,  these are a few of the more commonly found features that you might want to keep in mind.Electric brake: Reverses the flow of electricity when the saw's trigger is released.  This is an important safety feature that slows the blade quickly in case of emergency.Blade guard: Most miter saws have self-retracting guards that withdraw when the saw  is lowered for use, and reappear when it is raised.Laser guide: Gives a precise visual line where the cut will occur on your workpiece.Dust bag: Helps collect sawdust for a clearer, more tidy cutting area.Shaft lock: Immobilizes the shaft and blade for quicker, easier blade changes.Table extensions: Mount on either side of the saw to help balance longer  workpieces.Miter Saw BladesMiter saw blades come in a variety of different sizes, grades, and materials, but there are  three main types: steel, high-speed steel, and carbide-tipped blades.Steel: Inexpensive and good for cutting soft woods or plywoods. Sharpness diminishes  quickly in tougher materials.High-Speed Steel: More rugged than steel blades, and great for cutting harder woods.Carbide-Tipped: More expensive than other blades but much more durable. Maintain  sharpness over a longer period."

8654,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 6537-22 Super Sawzall with Quik-Lok Blade Clamp,"For years, Milwaukee's Sawzalls have been valued for their outstanding ability to cut through almost any material: wood, nail-embedded wood, steel, cast iron, aluminum, brass, drywall, composition materials, hard rubber, cement, brick, plaster, and fiberglass. The Super Sawzall features variable-speed control, with a speed control dial for faster cutting and better efficiency and control over a wide range of materials and applications. The blade is reversible, too, allowing you to cut upside down in tight spaces. For those of you who've grown up with Sawzalls, you'll appreciate the addition of the handy Quik-Lok blade clamp, which lets you change blades quickly without having to use a hex wrench; this feature is especially convenient when you're cutting hard materials, such as steel, a situation in which blades break frequently. There's also a handy quick lever adjustment for the shoe.We really like this tool's counterbalancing mechanism, which reduces some of the unavoidable vibration found in reciprocating saws. The difference you feel when operating this tool, compared to nonbalanced saws, is significant: the Super Sawzall is still extremely powerful, yet it has a smooth feel. As a result, of course, you can work longer with less fatigue than you can using other, unbalanced saws. Another significant feature is the clutch, which absorbs shock and impacts to the internal mechanics caused by sudden blade lockups (typically encountered during extreme use). While this is unquestionably a heavy tool, it does have a comfortable, ergonomically designed rubber grip that gives you a solid hold. And you can rely on the Super Sawzall to handle the most difficult jobs, either at home or at work.--Tim Block"

9404,Tools & Home Improvement,Bosch 3912 15 amp 12-inch Compound Miter Saw with Dust Bag and Work Clamp,"What the Bosch 12-inch compound miter saw may lack in popularity compared to some of its competitors, it makes up for in quality design and construction. The saw has a heavy-duty 26-inch steel table that extends to 29 inches, and a tall sliding fence for working with crown molding and other large stock. While this isn't the lightest 12-inch saw available, at only 43 pounds it's still plenty portable, and comes with a cushioned top handle for easy carrying to and from the truck. Considering how solid and stable this tool is, and the amount of metal making up the base and table, we were actually surprised to find that it weighs as little as it does. The 15 amp motor on this saw, in typical Bosch fashion, runs remarkably smooth and relatively quiet. The electric brake stops the blade quickly every time. The miter gauge on this saw is engraved, so if the paint wears off you won't lose the markings or need to replace the saw. This is a great feature, and the Bosch saw is one of only a couple of saws on the market that includes it. It also features nine miter detents that can be easily overridden for micro adjustments, and we had no problem getting the table to lock in tight at a half degree off the detent. The saw has a comfortable horizontal D-handle, with a nice wide trigger and a safety switch inset in the handle right where your thumb can reach it. This saw offers all the accuracy and cutting capacity of other 12 inchers in a design that's easy and comfortable to use. Best of all, it comes with the Bosch reputation for solid engineering and smooth performance. The saw comes with a quick-action clamp, a directional dust chute, a dust bag, a 40-tooth carbide blade, and wrenches for adjusting the fence and changing the blade. --Brian TrinenChoosing a Miter SawMiter saws are versatile tools that have become a mainstay of workshops everywhere. These  powerful saws make angled cuts by pulling a circular blade down onto a workpiece with a short,  controlled plunge. It might appear that miter saws are infinitely complex and varied, but there  are only three general types. The type you choose will depend on your woodworking needs.Basic Miter SawsBasic miter saws are the least versatile off the three major variations, but they&#x92;re a great  starting point for novice do-it-yourselfers. These models typically adjust for miter cuts only,  so consider upgrading if you need to do more than that.Compound Miter SawCompound miter saws are easier to use than basic miter saws because you can place your stock  flat for cutting, and they adjust simultaneously for miter and bevel cuts. A compound miter saw  is great for jobs that feature stock that's not very tall or wide, such as door and window trim  or picture frames.Sliding Compound Miter SawsSliding compound miter saws are the most versatile of the available models. They have a motor  and blade assembly that's mounted on a moveable arm to accommodate longer, wider workpieces. For  smaller pieces, the saw performs like an ordinary fixed-head model. On some models, the blade  can only pivot in one direction, but on adualsliding compound miter saw, the blade can  tilt to the right or left.Important Features at a GlanceThough models will vary by manufacturer and design,  these are a few of the more commonly found features that you might want to keep in mind.Electric brake: Reverses the flow of electricity when the saw's trigger is released.  This is an important safety feature that slows the blade quickly in case of emergency.Blade guard: Most miter saws have self-retracting guards that withdraw when the saw  is lowered for use, and reappear when it is raised.Laser guide: Gives a precise visual line where the cut will occur on your workpiece.Dust bag: Helps collect sawdust for a clearer, more tidy cutting area.Shaft lock: Immobilizes the shaft and blade for quicker, easier blade changes.Table extensions: Mount on either side of the saw to help balance longer  workpieces.Miter Saw BladesMiter saw blades come in a variety of different sizes, grades, and materials, but there are  three main types: steel, high-speed steel, and carbide-tipped blades.Steel: Inexpensive and good for cutting soft woods or plywoods. Sharpness diminishes  quickly in tougher materials.High-Speed Steel: More rugged than steel blades, and great for cutting harder woods.Carbide-Tipped: More expensive than other blades but much more durable. Maintain  sharpness over a longer period."

The keyless chuck has a grip tough enough to match the motor's high  torque and can hold the big bits you'll want to use with this drill.The blade-left, 24-volt circular saw offers as much power and cut  capacity as you could ask for in a cordless saw. It can easily cut  regular 1-1/2-inch-thick material at a full 50-degree bevel, and the  bevel mechanism has a positive stop at 45 degrees. The saw also  features tool-free, rear-pivot depth-of-cut adjustments and tool-free  bevel adjustments. The wrench for blade changes stores in a clip right  on the base. The rear battery configuration on this saw allowed Bosch  to give the tool good, even balance while maintaining a nice low  profile.Powered by one of Bosch's 24-volt batteries, the flashlight included in  this kit might well be called a spotlight. It offers all the  illumination you need, and has a two-position pivoting head and an  adjustable focus. The batteries on Bosch's 24-volt tools are 2 amp hr  ni-cads, made for Bosch by Panasonic. While we really like the padded  grips Bosch uses on its cordless tools, the 24-volt battery does add a  little extra heft to these tools, and no matter how nice the grip is,  you will notice the extra weight if you carry this in your hand all  day. This kit is ideal for contractors and other professionals looking  for heavy-duty tools at a great price.The full kit includes the 1/2-inch drill, a 6-1/2-inch circular saw, the flashlight, two 24-volt batteries, a one-hour charger, a side handle for the drill, and a case that holds it all.--Brian Trinen"

10717,All Electronics,"NXG Technology NX-PRO8300 3-Way In-Wall Speakers with 8&quot; Woofers (White, Pair)","Reclaim your living room while rediscovering the joy of music. NXG Technology's 3-way NX-PRO8300 in-wall/in-ceiling speakers make powerful accessories for your stereo or surround-sound listening. Each of the two speakers is outfitted with a large, 8-inch titanium-anodized, injection-molded woofer with a durable rubber surround, a 2.5-inch titanium-anodized Mylar midrange driver, and a 1-inch liquid-cooled, titanium-dome tweeter.The tweeters swivel so you can tailor their position to your listening area, and both the tweeter and the midrange driver feature an adjustable control to let you adjust their output level to your taste or to help you compensate for conditions in your listening environment. (A room with highly reflective hardwood floors, for instance, might sound better with less tweeter output than a carpeted room.)With in-wall speakers, the wall and the space behind it actually become the speaker cabinet, resonating with lower (bass) frequencies that would be lost without the focusing a cabinet provides. As such, the speaker depth is just 4 inches, yet they still deliver an impressive, full-range 35 to 22,000 Hz frequency response. Mounted flush to the wall, they occupy absolutely no floor space. This discreet, compact format is perfect for applications where traditional speakers would be impractical or impossible--or simply unsightly.The speakers' sensitivity is rated at 90 dB (1 watt @ 1 meter), which means they're easily driven; NXG recommends use with integrated amplifiers or surround receivers ranging from 5 to 150 watts (maximum) per channel. The speakers sound great on their own, but you can also use them to bring music from your living-room system to additional rooms in the house.NXG recommends using a minimum of 16-gauge speaker wire for all installations, keeping in mind that gauge decreases as the wire thickens (i.e. 14-gauge wire is thicker than 16-gauge wire). You may paint the perforated speaker grilles, as well as the frames, to match any room.What's in the BoxTwo speakers with removable grilles, a mounting template, and a user's manual with warranty information.Note: Tools required for installation include a drill and bits, a stud finder, a utility knife or drywall saw, a level, wire cutter/strippers, and speaker wire or speaker cable (all sold separately)."

This is what makes the intuitive, easy-to-use Drill Doctor sharpener so useful.Three Easy Steps Ensure Bits Are Sharp and EffectiveWith the Drill Doctor 750X, you simply align the bit by setting it against the stop and locking it in place. To sharpen the bit, you turn the chuck an even number of half turns, depending on the size of your bit. As you sharpen, long jaws hold the bit precisely in place, and jaw guides eliminate jaw twisting on small bits. This secure alignment system ensures that you maintain accurate bit geometry and don't damage the integrity of your tools.Once the bit is sharpened, the Drill Doctor 750X gives you the option of making a unique BACK-CUT split-point bit that gives your bit an extra-narrow chisel point, making it faster to penetrate and less likely to wander on the material you are drilling in to.Additionally, the drill point splitting port offers a ""Push to Stop"" design that will prevent over-splitting the bit point. The adjustable material take-off allows you to change the amount of bit material that is removed to accommodate large, broken bits or extend the life of small, precision tools.Engineered for Versatility and FlexibilityThe same chuck can be used to sharpen bits of all sizes, from 3/32- to 3/4-inch, whether they are English, metric, or letter gauge bits. The Drill Doctor 750X sharpens a wide variety of bit types, from high-speed steel, carbide, cobalt, TiN-coated, masonry, and split-point bits for working with metal.Professional Design and Construction for DurabilityFor added durability, the Drill Doctor 750X features a metal split-point port and a die-cast point angle shuttle. The tool relies on a permanent-magnet motor that produces consistent power, regardless of speed or load.The Drill Doctor 750X also relies on an industrial-strength diamond sharpening wheel that won't change shape over time, and a cool design that means bits don't heat up and lose their tempering as you sharpen them. This wheel, which is good for about 200 sharpenings, is easy for users to replace.As a bonus, the Drill Doctor 750X comes with a rugged shell case, making it easy to transport to the job site. This durable case offers internal storage space for your Drill Doctor, two chucks, two sharpening wheels, and a storage area for small drill bits or other accessories.The Drill Doctor is backed by a three-year manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.What's in the BoxDrill bit sharpener, hard-shell carrying case, user guide, and instructional DVD."

The number of flutes varies; fewer flutes provide better chip-carrying capacity, while more flutes produce a finer finish. High-speed steel (HSS) is a common general purpose steel for cutting tools, is compatible with a variety of materials and tends to be less expensive than most other cutter materials. With no coating or surface treatment, this uncoated tool can be used on a broad range of materials.The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles&#x2019; strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles&#x2019; increased cutting action. The tool&#x2019;s square end has straight cutting edges that create sharp, unrounded cuts, while the center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool that support making pocket cuts, profiling, and slotting. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001"" to -0.000"". The end mill has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

The fence can also drop flush to the table for ripping laminates.In fact, this saw is loaded with great, user-friendly features. There's an oversize, left-side on/off switch that lets you bump the saw off with your knee if you run into trouble while making a cut. It's exactly this sort of attention to detail that wins a lot of people over to DeWalt products. The blade-elevation crank is also set lower on this saw than most, so there's plenty of hand clearance for making blade-height adjustments. Again, this might seem like a minor touch until you think about how frustrating it is to bang your knuckles on a table bottom every time you want to change the blade height. This table's sturdy metal bevel scale is a nice touch, too; it's easy to read and much burlier than the mere stickers found on a lot of other saws.The saw's inboard 1-3/4-horsepower induction motor is quiet, cuts down on vibration, and makes this saw considerably more space-efficient than outboard motor saws, a feature you'll appreciate if you work in a small shop or have to take your saw through doorways.

Also offering TiCo high-density carbide tips, laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that eliminate the need for stabilizers, and Freud's Perma-SHIELD coating to prevent the buildup of friction and heat, this multi-purpose blade is built for lasting convenience.LU84R009 Combination Saw Blade with Perma-SHIELDAt a Glance:Ideal for crosscutting materials 3/4 to 3-1/2inches thick, and ripping materials 3/8 to 1-1/2inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-SHIELD coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter9""Teeth40 COMBArbor5/8""Kerf (K).126Plate (P).087Large Gulletsallow for fast ripping and easy chip removalLaser-Cut Anti-Vibration Slotsdrastically reduce vibration and sideways movement in the cut extending blade life, and giving a crisp, swirl-free flawless finishCombination Tooth Design for Versatility and AccuracyThis blade's 40 teeth are arranged in groups of five, each of which includes one flat-top raker tooth for fast, accurate ripping. Each flat tooth is followed by four alternating-top-bevel (ATB) teeth that are particularly well suited to crosscutting, and large gullets between the teeth ensure effective chip clearance.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting materials that are 3/4 to 3-1/2 inches thick, or ripping materials that are 3/8 to 1-1/2 inches thick. It makes quick work of hard- and softwood, plywood, and chipboard. It can also handle laminates or tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis combination saw blade's 40 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""combination blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge for longer when faced with a variety of applications, this blend includes just a little bit more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends. And it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

12666,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 0379-1 3.5 Amp 1/2-Inch Close Quarter Drill,"Milwaukee's close-quarters drill is designed to make drilling  in tight and hard-to-reach spaces as easy as possible. The drill has a  stout 3.5 amp motor that provides trigger-controlled variable speeds  from 0 to 750 rpm. It also comes with a heavy-duty keyed chuck. To  prevent loss, a chuck key attaches to the cord via a rubber tie. The  two things that make this drill so effective in close-quarters work are  the 55-degree chuck angle and the molded grip situated directly behind  the chuck--two features that combine to put the user's pushing force  directly behind the bit. This is key, of course, because you tend to  have less strength to offer when you're holding a drill in a tight or  hard-to-reach space. By making efficient use of the strength you do put  into the operation, Milwaukee's drill makes the job that much easier.  Lastly, we also really like the convenient location of the trigger  switch, even if it is sometimes a little too easy to pull before you  intend to. This drill comes in handy for electrical work and cabinetry.  Milwaukee also makes a 3/8-inch chuck with a higher top speed.--Brian Trinen"

Technically, the rosewood handles are dishwasher safe, but you'll want to hand wash them and occasionally apply a food-grade mineral oil to keep the handles looking their best. --Doree Armstrong"
12725,Industrial & Scientific,"Nylon 6/6 Machine Screw, Oval Head, Slotted Drive, M2.5-0.45, 4mm Length (Pack of 25)","Machine Screws, also referred to as Machine Bolts, are often used with nuts or driven into tapped holes.  They come in a variety of head types and drive styles, but are generally available in smaller sizes.Nylon 6/6 is a general purpose thermoplastic with outstanding resistance to organic chemicals, acids and alkalis.  Nylon wears well against other surfaces; it is readily machinable and may be milled, turned and cut with conventional machine tools.  It does exhibit some dimensional swelling in wet applications which should be taken into account with its use.  Tensile strength of this material is 12,000 psi (pounds per square inch).Similar to a flat-head style, the oval head style has a slightly convex top surface; it is typically used for appearance.  Common applications for slotted screws include woodworking, although the drive style is not designed to be used with power drivers.A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter (in millimeters), followed by the thread pitch (millimeters per thread), which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Coarse threads are better when working with brittle materials; they are sturdier and are easier to thread and unthread compared to fine.  Coarse threading also allows for thicker coatings and platings."

A special saw needs a special blade, and here it is. This 3-3/8"" blade wears 24 carbide-tipped teeth and produces a super-smooth cut. Sure, you can spend less on a steel blade, but in the long run, you're better off with carbide because it holds an edge far longer and so gives you a better cut.

12745,Tools & Home Improvement,Makita LS1220 12-Inch Compound Miter saw,"Makita's 12-inch compound miter saw is a big, well-balanced saw--perfect for anyone looking for both precision cutting and the capacity to handle large stock. The saw miters to 48 degrees right and left and bevels left 45 degrees. Makita's saw also features an electronic speed control that automatically accelerates the blade up when making a difficult cut (similar to the way a car's cruise control functions when going over hills); as a result, the blade doesn't lag. The pivot fence adjusts for supporting large stock and flips back for bevel cuts. The saw's nine positive stops make it easy to lock in common miters, plus each stop is deep-cast into the body of the saw, so it's hard to imagine the saw would ever develop slop. The miter lock on this saw has a screw handle, a design that's a little more time-consuming than a cam-locking handle. On this 12-inch saw, Makita opted for a more ergonomic D-handle design, which goes easy on a user's wrist, but it's a limitation if you want to operate the saw with your left hand. We really like the soft start and electric brake, though; they're user-friendly features that make a big difference, especially when a job requires a lot of constant, repetitive cuts. And, for home shop users, this saw has the added option of a release safety button that pulls out and locks the saw off.--Jon Groebner"

Case chrome vanadium blades are known for their edge-holding ability and easy resharpening.  However, they are less resistant to rusting, pitting and discoloration than stainless steel.

This handy, high-performance tool lets you avoid the hassle of compressor noise and hoses. Also, it&rsquo;s easy to handle and hold, offers consistent performance, and supplies the right amount of power for a range of uses..caption {font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif;font-size: 10px;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;}ul.indent {list-style: inside disc;text-indent: 20px;}img.withlink {border:1px black solid;}a.nodecoration {text-decoration: none}The highly visible, easy-to-access load magazine makes reloading quick and simple.View larger.Batteries charge in under two hours for convenient, cord-free power.View larger.Each red fuel cartridge drives up to 1200 nails (fuel cell not included).View larger.Lightweight, Hose-Free Operation Minimizes Arm FatigueMeasuring 12.0 inches long and weighing just 7.3 pounds, the IMCT Framing Nailer is comfortable to handle and hold. Its 'sure grip' and well-balanced design combine with a soft trigger to reduce arm fatigue. And because you won&rsquo;t have to drag a hose with you as you work, you&rsquo;ll be able to drive nails better and longer, without undue stress on your arms, hands, and wrists.Compact, Heavy-Duty Design Works Anywhere and EverywhereCompact enough to work in tight, hard-to-reach areas, the IMCT Framing Nailer packs a powerful punch with heavy-duty construction that can handle tough job conditions. It shoots up to 1,200 nails on a single fuel cell and up to 4,000 nails on a full battery charge, providing a cycle rate of two to three nails per second. And because it offers tool-free depth-of-drive adjustment--no wrenches required!--you can get more done in less time.Internal Combustion Linear Motor for Robust PerformanceUnlike other power fastening tools, the IMCT Framing Nailer is powered by an internal combustion linear motor. In simpler terms, the nailer owes its robust performance to its motor, which is similar to an automobile's motor. Additionally, the tool ignites a fuel and air mixture to produce the energy needed to drive the motor, and ultimately, the fastener.Patented Battery System for Consistency and ReliabilityAnother unique feature of this nailer is that it uses a patented system that requires both a fuel cell and a rechargeable battery (the fuel cell is not included). This translates to optimum consistency and reliability, whether you&rsquo;re building a deck, working with wall sheathing, or repairing a roof. It also means the IMCT Framing Nailer is entirely self-contained. The tool carries its own fuel supply and battery--along with a supply of fasteners--making it easy to bring with you from site to site.Lockout Feature to Prevent Blank Firing and Wood DamageThe IMCT Framing Nailer boasts a lockout feature to prevent needless blank cycling, which can waste fuel and damage both the wood you&rsquo;re working with and the nailer's components. This feature works by ensuring that five nails will be left in the magazine when the follower reaches the lockout area. Additionally, the tool will not operate when its nail supply has less than six nails.High-Visibility Magazine and Belt Hanger for ConvenienceThe IMCT Framing Nailer is designed to be exceptionally user friendly, with features that help keep your job running smoothly. First, the load magazine is highly visible, so it helps prevent you from running out of nails in the middle of a project. There&rsquo;s also a convenient dual-position belt hanger, so you don't have to lay the nailer on the ground or on top of a ladder, nor do you have to wedge it among rafters. And if you can't remember where you last placed your nailer, its bright orange color makes it easy to spot.About the Battery Charging SystemThe IMCT Framing Nailer comes with a rechargeable battery and its own charging system. This charging system is the only one that will work with Paslode batteries (both round and oval). When your tool arrives, you&rsquo;ll first need to charge the battery. Batteries will generally take five minutes to two hours to recharge, depending on the amount of discharge within the battery.Dimensions and Warranty InformationThe IMCT Framing Nailer has a height of 14.5 inches and weighs 7.3 pounds. It comes with a one-year limited warranty on all parts, a five-year warranty on all molded nylon parts, and a 90-day limited warranty on the bumper, driver blades, O-rings, and seal rings.What's in the BoxNailer, 6.0-volt battery, charger, belt hanger, rugged plastic carrying case, safety goggles, manual, and 5/32-inch hex wrench.The IMCT Framing Nailer is designed to for easy handling and reliable, professional performance."

Once you start opening the knife, SOG's Patented SOG Assisted Technology, or S.A.T., takes over. Through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs in the knife, the force to propel the knife open becomes greater than the closing force, and the blade will open on its own. This unique feature means that if you are using your dominant hand on another task, you can just as easily open the FSA-98 with your other hand.For security and peace of mind, S.A.T. was developed in conjunction with a superior locking system. The unique design of S.A.T. knives allows them to use locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access ambidextrously than conventional liner locks.For Flash Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be released quickly with a sliding button. An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed. For easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to open.Cryogenic Heat Treatment for Sharp, Dependable BladesOf course the workhorse of any knife is the cutting surface, and FSA-98 offers a full, 3.5-inch, half-serrated blade with an elegant satin finish.SOG's proprietary Cryogenic Heat Treatment process ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul. This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly bringing the blade's temperature down to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then bringing it slowly back to room temperature. The stress created through this process relieves the material on an atomic level and increases overall strength and edge retention.Elegant, Ergonomic Design for Ease of UseEven if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make the cuts you want if a knife doesn't sit comfortably in your hand. That's why the handle on this knife features a unique, ergonomic contour. Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle helps ensure that your knife is both durable and well-balanced. And it is lightly textured to prevent slippage.At just 3.1 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry. A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible.This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in workmanship and materials.About SOG: Strong, Innovative, Specialty ToolsSOG originally stood for Studies and Observation Group, an elite joint services military group designed to handle covert operations during the Vietnam War.

Studs are generally shorter in length than Threaded Rods.Stainless steels are used for their corrosion resistance, high-temperature strength, scaling resistance, and low-temperature toughness.&#xA0; These properties account for their extremely wide use in practically every industry.  Austenitic Stainless Steels are alloys of iron and carbon that contain between 16% and 30% Chromium, a maximum of 0.15% carbon, along with Nickel (or Manganese), and other alloying elements.&#xA0; The chromium, which helps develop a passive surface oxide film, provides corrosion resistance in stainless steels.&#xA0;&#xA0; Austenitic Stainless Steels are designated by a 3 digit SAE Stainless Steel Grade beginning with the number 3 (e.g. 304, 316).&#xA0; Another common naming convention for Austenitic Stainless Steels are 18/8, 18/10, 18/0, etc. where the 18 refers to the % of Chromium and 8 to the % of Nickel contained in the material.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter (in millimeters), followed by the thread pitch (millimeters per thread), which indicates if it is coarse or fine.

13877,Tools & Home Improvement,"PORTER-CABLE 743K 7-1/4-Inch, 15 Amp Framers Saw with Carrying Case (Blade on Left)","Porter-Cable's 7-1/4-inch blade-left circular saw is an excellent choice for builders who want a saw with power (it has a 15 amp motor) but that's not as heavy or difficult to handle as a wormdrive saw (it weighs only 10-1/2 pounds). Traditionally, sidewinder saws have the blade on the right side, so most right-handers are accustomed to looking over the saw to sight a line. A left-side blade lets a left-hander cut the same way--and some right-handed users, especially those accustomed to using (blade-left) wormdrive saws, will also appreciate the better blade visibility such a saw affords. In the end, it's really just a matter of personal preference.To lighten the saw, Porter-Cable used lightweight, durable magnesium--which  won't crack or bend--for the blade guards and part of the housing. The saw's  still tough, though; in fact, Porter-Cable boasts that this saw can sustain up  to a 6-foot drop without damage. This saw also sports a very flat, very strong  cast-magnesium table, too, with reinforced ribs that make it very difficult to  bend or break. (Can someone tell us why some companies ruin a good saw by giving  it a wimpy table?)Porter-Cable took care of the details, too. The no-catch lip on the blade guard  helps ensure the guard won't catch on an edge at the beginning of a cut, and it  keeps a user's hands away from the retraction lever. The 360-degree adjustable  top dust nozzle lets you direct sawdust in any direction, and you can easily  attach a dust bag or a shop vac to collect the dust--a particularly handy  feature for a remodeler who wants to make a couple of cuts indoors without  making a mess. There's also a clip on the top of the saw that lets you clamp the  cord off to the side when you're cutting sheet material, so it's less likely to  drag behind and snag the edge. A heavy-duty carrying case comes included, too,  though it's a little tricky getting the saw to fit inside.--Jon Groebner"

This is your go-to set for efficiently creating dadoes and grooves in a wide range of materials from hardwood to laminate. Boasting thick MicroGrain carbide tips and an anti-kickback design, the set's two outside blades can be resharpened for long-term accuracy. For added versatility, the kit cuts grooves spanning 1/4 to 7/8 inch and includes a shim set.Resharpening Blades for Smooth, Splinter-Free DadoesThe perfect dado set for the fine cabinetmaker or weekend woodworker, the Freud SD208 produces dadoes and grooves that meet with flush, even edges. So you can be assured of precise cuts every time, the set is equipped with precision-grade features, starting with two proprietary outside blades that can be resharpened to deliver accuracy for the long term.These high-quality eight-inch, 12-tooth blades with 5/8-inch arbors cut dadoes and grooves that are clean, flat, and virtually splinter free. Cuts made by these blades are accurate the first time, saving you from making repeated passes over the same workpiece.Flexibility for Cutting Hardwoods, Laminates, and MoreThe Freud SD208 accommodates a wide range of materials, so you can use it from project to project. And because it requires less power to feed, it is ideal for use with underpowered saws. Use it to create dadoes and grooves in hardwood, softwood, chip board, plywood, and laminate (not recommended for non-ferrous materials).Two-Wing Chippers, Spacers, and Shim Set for Fine AdjustmentsThe set's included chippers/spacers (three 1/8-inch chippers and three 1/16-inch spacers) save you time and energy. With their two-wing design, they efficiently remove waste material and smooth the edges of your workpiece. Plus, they allow you to fine-tune your cuts from 1/4 to 7/8 inch, so you have accurate control over the desired width.And with the Freud SD208's included shim set, you never have to give up making dadoes with a workpiece that's too thin to fit the width of your dado blades. This handy shim set expands the range of your kerf adjustments, giving you even greater control for achieving a flawless finished workpiece.Anti-Kickback Design for Safe OperationThe quality of this dado set is enhanced by its anti-kickback design, which gives you an added margin of safety while you work.MicroGrain Carbide Tips for Long-Lasting PerformanceSo you can get maximum performance out of this set, the blade components are constructed with Freud's TiCo Hi-Density Carbide. This means the blades can withstand numerous sharpenings and still retain their precision. And a Tri-metal Brazing process gives the blades impact resistance, so they last for the long term without dulling (a condition that can cause torn wood and uneven cuts).About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

13974,Tools & Home Improvement,DEWALT DW420 5-Inch Heavy Duty Random Orbit Sander with PSA Pad (No Dust Collection),"DeWalt's 5-inch random-orbit sander is a great tool for professional woodworkers and painters, as well as homeowners looking for a reliable sander for do-it-yourself projects. It has a 2 amp motor that provides 12,000 orbits per minute, with a 3/32 orbit diameter. Its controlled finishing system maintains consistent control over the pad speed, minimizing gouging at startup. We found that the sander removes material quickly and leaves a good finish. While it has less vibration than many sanders we've tried--thanks in part to DeWalt's dual-plane counterbalanced fan--we found that gripping the tool from the side rather than from the top seemed easier on the hands, and thought the top grip could get tiresome in extended-use situations. We liked the dust canister configuration on this tool, which uses a simple and effective twist-lock mechanism to prevent air pressure from popping the canister off the tool. The sealed switch prevents problems from dust contamination. This is a good reliable sander, stripped of the dust collection system and variable-speed control, for people who need a solid sander without a big price tag.--Brian Trinen"

13996,Tools & Home Improvement,Bosch 4000 10-Inch Worksite Table Saw,"Bosch's 10-inch Worksite table saw might just be the best of the current bunch. Benchtop table saws--which weigh 60 to 100 pounds and are light enough for one person to carry from the truck to the job site--have increased in popularity in recent years. They set up easily on a workbench or sawhorses and generally feature stable components that make them great for pros and serious hobbyists alike. Although at 60 pounds the Bosch is lighter than any other saw in its class, this saw is no lightweight. It sports a die-cast undercarriage and powerful 4.4-horsepower, 15 amp motor--burly components that make it a serious, albeit slight, contender. Conveniently, the Bosch comes ready to use right out of the box; we were making cuts about 10 minutes after the UPS delivery. Plus, it's the only benchtop table saw with an arbor lock, so mounting the blade is a one-wrench affair (less chance for busted knuckles). The wrench--like all those that come with Bosch tools--is forged, rather than stamped, and so there are no sharp edges that dig into your hand during blade changes. It's a small detail, but one that matters and one that's typical of the attention to detail paid by Bosch engineers.A flip of the paddle-style on/off switch initiates the soft-start electronics, which ramp the blade up to speed quickly without any disturbing jolt. The electronic feedback, popular on many saws today, keeps the blade turning at a constant speed, no matter what the load. The fence is the heart of any table saw and we found Bosch's to be a beauty. It's well machined and locks securely and accurately to the table. The cam-lock handle is padded, seats flush, and feels good to use. Like the comparable DeWalt saw, the Bosch features an extendable fence that makes it easy to rip four-by-eight panel material. It feels solid and slides smoothly, and the scales are easy to read. (There's even a built-in magnifying glass to cut down on the squint factor.) As with all the new Bosch tools, wrenches and removable items store nicely onboard the saw. The fence snaps into a holder on the side of the saw and stays put, and the miter gauge slides into a slot on the front of the tool--yet another small detail that we appreciate. The bottom line? The Bosch is a powerful saw that handles big stock without bogging down.--Mark McDonald"

14040,Tools & Home Improvement,Skil HD5860 13 Amp 8-1/4-Inch 60-Degree Worm Drive Saw,"If you have ever tried to cut a sheet of plywood by yourself, you'll understand how easily a circular saw can bind in the cut (curf) or kick back when the saw is first turned on. Well, not with a wormdrive saw like the HD5860. When you turn this baby on the torque from the motor actually twists the saw towards the material and with the power of a 13-amp motor, the wormdrive's cuts are fast, smooth and easy. Another important aspect of the wormdrive is that the blade is located on the left side of the tool, unlike sidewinder saws which are on the right side. This provides for an easily viewable cutting area without the need to extend your body over the saw housing or twist your arms and shoulders in order to watch the path of the blade.A dual front sight helps to guide the saw along a marked line when cutting at 90, 45 or 60 degree angles. That's right, you can now cut stock up to 2 inches deep when set at a 60-degree angle, an exclusive feature of the HD5860. The durable cast aluminum motor and gear housing and an easily accessed oil refill port all make for a long-lasting and durable tool, something you've come to expect from Skil.--C. Dwight Barnett"

Instead, air is pushed through a charcoal filtration system that removes pollutants before circulating the air back into your home. The benefit of such a system is that household temperatures and humidity are easier to maintain, as the internal air never leaves the kitchen. Recirculating range hoods are also generally far easier to install, as complex ventilation systems and vent pipe are not required.

High-speed steel (HSS) is a common, general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. With no coating or surface treatment, this uncoated tool can be used on a broad range of materials.The tool&#x2019;s square end has straight cutting edges that create sharp, unrounded cuts, while the center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool that support making pocket cuts, profiling, and slotting. The end mill&#x2019;s two flutes have better chip-carrying capacity than end mills with more flutes while offering additional support when the tool goes deep into the material in applications with a high depth of cut. The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles&#x2019; strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles&#x2019; increased cutting action. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001"" to -0.000"". The end mill has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

14612,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 0234-6 Magnum 5.5 Amp 1/2-Inch Drill,"For day in, day out drilling and driving in wood, steel, or plastic, there might not be a better tool than Milwaukee's Magnum hole shooter. The aluminum/magnesium alloy on the gear case cuts down on the tool's weight, and the glass-reinforced nylon handle makes it a bit lighter, too--but let there be no doubts: when it comes to results, this is the same heavy-duty, ridiculously powerful, no-nonsense tool it's always been. The shooter is built with a stacked design--meaning the drill's interior parts stack on top of each other--which makes replacing parts (like a switch) much easier to do as the whole drill doesn't need to be taken apart. The handle is designed so you can hold it two ways--either pistol-grip or with the palm of your hand resting on the top back portion--making the drill an extension of your arm.

Cuts made by these blades are accurate the first time, saving you from making repeated passes over the same workpiece.Flexibility for Cutting Hardwoods, Laminates, and MoreThe Freud SD308 fits all table saws and radial-arm saws and accommodates a wide range of materials, so you can use it from project to project. Use it to create dadoes and grooves in hardwood, softwood, chip board, plywood, and laminate (not recommended for non-ferrous materials).Two-Wing Chippers for Truly Flat-Bottom GroovesThe set's five included chippers (four 1/8-inch chippers and one 1/16-inch chipper) save you time and energy. With their two-wing design, they efficiently remove waste material and smooth the edges of your workpiece. Plus, with the help of the included Shim Set, you can fine-tune your cuts from 1/4 to 13/16 inch in 1/16-inch increments amd adkist the kerf width by as little a .04 inches.Anti-Kickback Design for Safe OperationThe quality of this dado set is enhanced by its anti-kickback design, which gives you an added margin of safety while you work.MicroGrain Carbide Tips for Long-Lasting PerformanceSo you can get maximum performance out of this set, the blade components are constructed with Freud's TiCo Hi-Density Carbide. This means the blades can withstand numerous sharpenings and still retain their precision. And a Tri-metal Brazing process gives the blades impact resistance, so they last for the long term without dulling (a condition that can cause torn wood and uneven cuts).About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

The 37-degree helix offers increased cutting action compared to end mills with lower helix angles, as it moves excess material quickly up the spiral and away from the workpiece. The two flutes have better chip-carrying capacity than end mills with more flutes while offering additional support when the tool goes deep into the material in applications with a high depth of cut.High-speed steel (HSS) is a common general-purpose steel for cutting tools; this tool has no coating or surface treatment. The tool&#x2019;s square end creates sharp, unrounded cuts. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool, so it can be fed into the workpiece like a drill bit. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001"" to -0.000"". The round shank accommodates a range of tool holders.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

15943,Tools & Home Improvement,PORTER-CABLE 552 13 Amp Production Pocket Cutter,"You simply can't beat a pocket hole cutter for production work. And this Porter-Cable is fast, accurate and helps you create a really strong joint. Perfect for kitchen and bathroom cabinet face frames as well as other furniture building, the machine has two motors that operate a router and  a drill, and produces a routed pocket with a perfectly placed pilot hole in literally two seconds.  The sleek six-degree angle doesn't allow for shifting, so you won't even need to clamp your work, saving you even more time and effort.This model cuts a 3/8-inch wide pocket and then drills a 9/64-inch pilot hole in one smooth operations. Keep in mind that it works with stock that is 1/2-inch to 15/16inch thick, but within that range, you'll need to use a shim with stock that measures 1/2-inch to 5/8-inch. Minimum stock dimensions are 1-1/2 inches in both length and width, but it works equally well on a wide variety of materials, including hard and soft woods, laminate, medium-density fiberboard, melamine and even particle board.The process is amazingly simple: Line up the center of your workpiece with the center notch on the clamping device. Tighten the clamp down, and with one smooth push and pull of the lever, you've cut  a smoothly routed pocket and drilled a precisely placed pilot hole. It couldn't be easier. If you haven't used a machine like this before, give yourself a few tries on scrap until you get the hang of the movement needed to make the cuts. If you're too fast, you'll get a rough cut; too slow and you'll burn your bits.Should you be working with a wider workpiece, there are notches 3/8-inch to each side of the center notch that can be used to make two pockets with their centers spaced exactly 3/4-inch apart.The only maintenance that this machine wants from you is a little housecleaning after use &#x96; the chips really accumulate quickly in the machine. A breath of fresh compressed air will clean out the debris and keep your motors running cool, and thus, longer.--Kris Jensen-Van Heste"

16037,Tools & Home Improvement,Freud LM72R008 8-Inch 24 Tooth FTG Ripping Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch Arbor and PermaShield Coating,"Designed for serious woodworkers, the 8-inch Freud LM72R008 Heavy-Duty Rip Saw Blade features an ultra-tough Perma-SHIELD coating that reduces heat and friction. It delivers smooth, fast cuts through hard- and softwood. Thanks to a rigid blade body and 24 oversized, flat-top teeth with TiCo high-density carbide tips, this is one dependable, long-lasting blade. Plus, its well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use stabilizers with it.LM72R008 Heavy-Duty Rip Saw Blade with Perma-SHIELDAt a Glance:Ideal for hard- or softwood that's 3/4 to 2-3/4 inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-SHIELD coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter8""Teeth24 FLATArbor5/8""Kerf (K).126Plate (P).087Depth of CutExtra Large, Flat Tooth Designleaves a smooth finish without the need for sanding or jointingLaser-Cut Anti-Vibration Slotsdrastically reduce vibration and sideways movement in the cut extending blade life, and giving a crisp, swirl-free flawless finishProfessional-Grade Design for Accurate Glue Line CutsOffering fast, ""glue line"" precision cuts and an anti-kickback design, this heavy-duty rip saw blade handles tough industrial ripping tasks without requiring you to add any stabilizers to your setup. It's ideal for working with hard- or softwoods that are 3/4 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it can be used in gang-rip operations. This versatile blade handles crosscuts with chipboard, plywood, or laminate, and can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf.The extra-large, flat teeth featured on this blade leave a smooth, splinter-free finish that eliminates the need for sanding and jointing. This large-tooth design also allows the blade to be safely sharpened more times, prolonging the life of the blade and saving you money. And the large gullets between these teeth ensure easy chip removal.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis heavy-duty rip saw blade's 24 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""ripping blend."" This blend offers a mix of improved density, hardness, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that's ideally matched to the demands of ripping large quantities of thick, hard wood.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--once again, saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

It comes with four orbital-action settings, allowing you to make aggressive or precise cuts when needed. There's also a variable-speed trigger that lets you adjust the blade speed as you cut--a feature we really like in a jig saw.

For a second, it almost looks too good to use for work--but only for a second. This is a piece of shop equipment that makes a toolhound's heart beat faster. The saw's big table (28 by 38 inches) is impressively thick and durable, so it will stay flat and true. With the heaviest cast-iron trunnion of any 10-inch saw on the market, the model 66 virtually snuffs out all vibration. The double drive-belt system, hooked up to the burly 5-horsepower motor, delivers pretty astonishing power to the blade; we tried everything we could think of--including a big hunk of oak two-by--but the blade never bogged down for a second. A C-flange mount takes the weight of the motor, so the blade cranks up or down easily without the extra weight. The saw's hand wheels are also made of cast iron and have excellent clearance.The heart of any table saw, arguably, is the fence--and Powermatic's model 66 sports the award-winning Accu-Fence, a system that uses only two moving parts to create easy-gliding, precision, no-budge fence action. The left-tilting blade tilts away from the fence, which helps prevent kickback and binding of the stock, making for smoother cuts. The two-sided blade guards work independently of each other, so the blade is always covered. The guards also swing totally out of the way to make blade changes easy. Behind the blade, there are antikickback pawls for added safety. The saw's base has a clean-out door, allowing you easy access to the saw body and making cleanup a snap--no reaching around the saw components or having to remove the motor cover. You'll also receive a load of extras, including a dado insert, a motor cover, and an extension table and legs. Admittedly, this isn't a cheap saw; without a doubt, however, it is an excellent one that would make a great addition to any shop.--Jon Groebner"

With a  maximum torque rating of 500 inch-pounds, it's among the toughest  half-inch cordless drills currently available. That kind of torque  necessitates the included removable side handle and is likely to make  the user thankful for the drill's nice cushion grip. While it offers  only 16 clutch settings--a small number compared to the 18 to 24  settings on competing drills--this heavy-duty tool is really intended  as more drill than driver, and in most applications we can imagine, 16  settings is plenty. The keyless chuck has a grip tough enough to match  the motor's high torque and holds the big bits you'll want to use with  this drill. The batteries on Bosch's 24-volt tools are 2 amp hr ni-cads  made for Bosch by Panasonic. While we really like the padded grips  Bosch uses on its cordless tools, the 24-volt battery does add a little  extra heft to this drill, and no matter how nice the grip, you will  notice the weight if you carry this in your hand all day.

The gripper works by clamping onto the top of the material, creating a sturdy temporary handle for the person who is carrying them. It allows the user to lift and move them with a straight back, eliminating the requirement of bending over to get under the bottom, thus avoiding the torqued back and the aches and pains that are far too familiar to construction workers and do-it-yourselfers.

17477,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 0375-6 3.5 Amp 3/8-Inch Close-Quarter Drill,"Milwaukee's close-quarters drill is designed to make drilling  in tight and hard-to-reach spaces as easy as possible. The drill has a  stout 3.5 amp motor that provides trigger-controlled variable speeds  from 0 to 1,300 rpm. It also comes with a heavy-duty keyed chuck. To  prevent loss, a chuck key attaches to the cord via a rubber tie. The  two things that make this drill so effective in close-quarters work are  the 55-degree chuck angle and the molded grip situated directly behind  the chuck, two features that combine to put the user's pushing force  directly behind the bit. This is key, of course, because you tend to  have less strength to offer when you're holding a drill in a tight or  hard-to-reach space. By making efficient use of the strength you do put  into the operation, Milwaukee's drill makes the job that much easier.  Lastly, we also really like the convenient location of the trigger  switch, even if it is sometimes a little too easy to pull before you  intend to. This drill comes in handy for electrical work and cabinetry.  Milwaukee also makes a 1/2-inch chuck for use with bigger bits.--Brian Trinen"

The company owes its success to the inventive genius of its founder and namesake, Albert J. Dremel. In his lifetime, Mr. Dremel owned 55 patents on a wide range of products from electric erasers to a gas-powered rotary lawn mower. His most famous and important invention was a high-speed rotary tool, dubbed the Dremel Moto-Tool. Compact, lightweight, and perfect for a wide range of jobs, the rotary tool was an immediate hit with hobbyists and eventually became accepted as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. Today, the Dremel name remains synonymous with utility, durability, and innovation.What's in the BoxRotary tool, an assortment of 50 accessories, a three-hour charger, and a carrying case."

17660,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",Weber 3261001 Black Genesis Gold C Propane Gas Grill (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"At first glance, Weber gas grills look like something that might be shot into space or driven in a Formula 1 race rather than the sleek cooking machines they really are. This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis series of grills Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on your patio. The Genesis Gold-C features a generous 611 square inches of total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000 Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting fuel. The Genesis Gold-C also features a side burner, rated at 10,000 Btu's per hour, that's perfect for creating a side dish to accompany your perfectly cooked main course. In place of the lava rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber grills feature the company's patented porcelain-enameled Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats. Instead, juices sizzle and smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast.Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's Crossover Ignition System enables you to effortlessly start all three burners, which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the hood; it can also be removed and used as a meat thermometer to ensure a thoroughly cooked meal every time. And you won't need to scramble for seasonings (or recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a separate table while cooking, thanks to several convenient features. In addition to the handy work surface on one side of the unit, a wire condiment basket hangs along the front of the grill, keeping condiments, spices, marinades, or other barbecue necessities close at hand. A wire shelf is situated beneath the grill and stretches the length of the unit, and three wire tool hooks hang below the work surface, ready for your spatula, meat fork, and basting brush. Weber's propane gas grills also come with a 20-pound LP tank and a precision fuel gauge.With its lid open, the Genesis Gold-C measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2 inches wide, and 33 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved, however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which prevent it from moving when you're cooking.  While a grill cover is recommended to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or nests. Best of all, as this grill comes almost entirely assembled out of the box, the anxious griller will be able to have ribs roasting and burgers flipping in no time at all.

The night we moved in to our new house, a freak hailstorm flooded our basement. I borrowed my father-in-law's industrial-sized vacuum to clean up the mess, and it was just too big to maneuver in my basement and I almost broke my back lugging the eight-gallon tank up the stairs to empty it out.For most home applications, I think three-five gallons is about right, so this six-gallon model would be appropriate if you anticipate the need for more capacity but don't feel like you need the extra power of a four-HP or better model. Even with the slightly higher capacity, it's still small enough to be maneuverable in cramped quarters.The Quiet-Deluxe series, as the name suggests, are very quiet indeed, which makes this a good choice for home use. It has a blower feature for use in the yard, and comes with a selection of useful accessories. My one complaint about this model is that the hose was a little narrow, especially where it enters the vacuum. While I never had a problem with clogging, it seemed like this could be an issue depending on what you're trying to clean up.Other than that, this is a great little vacuum with enough power and capacity for most home or small-business applications.--Josh DettweilerWhat's in the BoxWet/dry vacuum, 1-1/4-inch by eight-foot hose, two 1-1/4 inch extension wands, 10 inch combination nozzle, squeegee, tool holder, cartridge filter"

19866,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 6460 15 Amp 10-1/4-Inch Circular Saw,"Milwaukee's 10-1/4-inch circular saw, also known as a beam cutter, packs a big 15 amp motor and has an equally big cutting capacity. It cuts four-by material in one pass (hence the nickname ""beam cutter""). Because the saw is so big, it comes with two handles, enabling you to handle the extra size and weight with confidence. While we understand there are design constraints on such a big saw, we prefer a rear pivoting depth adjustment to this saw's quick-drop system, as adjustments are easier to set with a rear pivot because you don't have to wrestle with the full weight of the saw. All-ball-and-roller-bearing construction and hardened steel gears, however, ensure this saw will have a long operational life. Some people choose Milwaukee saws over the competition because of the high-quality blades that are typically included: in this model, Milwaukee has included the Endurance blade. The kit also comes with a sturdy steel case, a nice touch.--Tim Block"

20371,Industrial & Scientific,"Niagara Cutter 33838 High Speed Steel (HSS) Square Nose End Mill, Inch, Weldon Shank, TiCN Finish, Finishing Cut, 37 Degree Helix, 3 Flutes, 4.25&quot; Overall Length, 0.375&quot; Cutting Diameter, 0.375&quot; Shank Diameter","The Niagara Cutter A337 TiCN-coated high-speed steel square nose end mill has three flutes and a 37-degree helix for milling aluminum and other non-ferrous materials. The 37-degree helix angle gives more support behind the cutting edge than higher angles and offers increased cutting action and chip evacuation compared to the conventional 30-degree helix. It efficiently cuts aluminum and other non-ferrous material, moving material up the spiral and away from the workpiece. The end mill&#x2019;s three flutes remove excess material from the cutting area and provide a third cutting edge to create an improved finish that may eliminate the need for a second finishing cut in some applications. The rounded area behind the cutting edge, called the cylindrical land, stabilizes the tool and smoothes the surface of the workpiece, minimizing tool vibration (chatter) when machining non-ferrous materials. The cutting edge is treated with extra grinding passes, minimizing surface roughness and creating a low-friction surface on the cutting edge to help prevent chips from sticking to the tool.The TiCN coating offers the increased hardness and abrasion resistance required to machine aluminum and other nonferrous materials, providing more abrasion resistance than TiN coating. High-speed steel (HSS) is a common, general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. The tool&#x2019;s square end creates sharp, unrounded cuts. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool, so it can be fed into the workpiece like a drill bit. The tool has an eccentric primary relief feature that provides better support behind the cutting edge than a flat relief, reducing tooth breakage in deep cuts. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001"" to -0.000"". The tool has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

21146,Tools & Home Improvement,Freud TR215 8-1/2-Inch Sliding Compound Miter saw,"Freud's 8-1/2-inch sliding compound miter saw is a reliable and reasonably priced saw that smoothly cuts wide stock. That said, people accustomed to other miter saws might find some of Freud's design characteristics to be less than user-friendly. This saw has a two-piece blade guard more like those found on radial-arm saws, and the two-button thumb switch is difficult to operate and a little annoying when trying to make repeated cuts. Making miter adjustments requires flipping a lever over to get out of the detent and then loosening a butterfly-type screw to release the table--another unique setup that could use improvement. But, despite these less-than-ideal features, this saw does make clean and accurate cuts and comes with an excellent Freud blade. It is solidly constructed, has a powerful motor, and should last a long time. For homeowners and do-it-yourselfers wanting the horizontal cutting capacity of a sliding compound miter saw, this is the most affordable way to go. Professionals may want to consider other models to avoid the extra labor resulting from this saw's design.--Brian Trinen"

The number of flutes varies; fewer flutes provide better chip-carrying capacity, while more flutes produce a finer finish. The general-purpose TiN coating combines stability at high temperatures with hardness for wear protection, increasing tool life and performance compared to uncoated end mills. (TiN is suitable for a range of materials, but TiCN or uncoated end mills are recommended for machining aluminum.) High-speed steel (HSS) is a common, general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials.The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles&#x2019; strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles&#x2019; increased cutting action. The tool&#x2019;s square end has straight cutting edges that create sharp, unrounded cuts, while the center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool that support making pocket cuts, profiling, and slotting. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001"" to -0.000"". The end mill has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

The blade is well-suited to cutting both hard-and softwood, as well as cutting through stacks of manmade material. It features teeth with a triple-chip grind (TCG). In this configuration, each flat-top tooth is followed by a trapezoidal tooth that's slightly higher. The trapezoidal tooth delivers a precut slot that's narrower than the final kerf, which helps prevent brittle materials--like chipboard--from chipping near the blade. Plus, the large gullets between these teeth ensure quicker cuts and easy chip removal.The blade's ideal crosscutting range includes materials that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, while the range when ripping includes materials that are 3/8 to 3/4-inch thick. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis heavy-duty saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""general purpose blend."" Formulated to maximize density, hardness, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance, this blend is ideally matched to the varied demands that are placed on a multi-purpose saw blade.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin BuildupThis blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or ""pitch"" buildup.Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

22487,Tools & Home Improvement,Hitachi C8FB2 9.5 Amp 8-1/2-Inch Sliding Compound Miter saw,"Hitachi's' 8-1/2-inch sliding compound miter saw is a tried-and-true favorite with professionals, who value its solid construction and reliable accuracy. It has a 9-1/2 amp motor with an electric brake, 11 positive miter stops, and 4 positive stops on the bevel gauge. We like the big wide table, the hefty base construction, and the embossed numbers and markers of the miter gauge. While the sliding fence is clearly designed with easy adjustment in mind, it's less durable than we would like to see and not too tall. The blade guard operates smoothly and doesn't obstruct the visibility of the work--an improvement over previous versions that had a tendency to hang up. This saw was among the first sliding compound miter saws out, and its solid, reliable design hasn't changed much or lost popularity, even after several years on the market and a lot more competition. Due to its solid construction, it remains accurate after a long time on the job, making it a consistent favorite with professional trim carpenters and everyone else whose work depends on exactitude. People who want the accuracy this saw offers but need more thickness capacity and the convenience of a double-bevel saw may want to consider Hitachi's 10-inch sliding compound miter saw. --Brian TrinenChoosing a Miter SawMiter saws are versatile tools that have become a mainstay of workshops everywhere. These powerful saws make angled cuts by pulling a circular blade down onto a workpiece with a short, controlled plunge. It might appear that miter saws are infinitely complex and varied, but there are only three general types. The type you choose will depend on your woodworking needs.Basic Miter SawsBasic miter saws are the least versatile off the three major variations, but they&#x92;re a great starting point for novice do-it-yourselfers. These models typically adjust for miter cuts only, so consider upgrading if you need to do more than that.Compound miter saws are easier to use than basic miter saws because you can place your stock flat for cutting, and they adjust simultaneously for miter and bevel cuts. A compound miter saw is great for jobs that feature stock that's not very tall or wide, such as door and window trim or picture frames.Sliding Compound Miter SawsSliding compound miter saws are the most versatile of the available models. They have a motor and blade assembly that's mounted on a moveable arm to accommodate longer, wider workpieces. For smaller pieces, the saw performs like an ordinary fixed-head model. On some models, the blade can only pivot in one direction, but on adualsliding compound miter saw, the blade can tilt to the right or left.Important Features at a GlanceThough models will vary by manufacturer and design, these are a few of the more commonly found features that you might want to keep in mind.Electric brake: Reverses the flow of electricity when the saw's trigger is released. This is an important safety feature that slows the blade quickly in case of emergency.Blade guard: Most miter saws have self-retracting guards that withdraw when the saw is lowered for use, and reappear when it is raised.Laser guide: Gives a precise visual line where the cut will occur on your workpiece.Dust bag: Helps collect sawdust for a clearer, more tidy cutting area.Shaft lock: Immobilizes the shaft and blade for quicker, easier blade changes.Table extensions: Mount on either side of the saw to help balance longer workpieces.Miter Saw BladesMiter saw blades come in a variety of different sizes, grades, and materials, but there are three main types: steel, high-speed steel, and carbide-tipped blades.Steel: Inexpensive and good for cutting soft woods or plywoods. Sharpness diminishes quickly in tougher materials.High-Speed Steel: More rugged than steel blades, and great for cutting harder woods.Carbide-Tipped: More expensive than other blades but much more durable. Maintain sharpness over a longer period."

23366,Tools & Home Improvement,PORTER-CABLE 3807 10-Inch Sliding Compound Miter saw,"Powered by a burly 15 amp motor, Porter-Cable's new 10-inch sliding  compound miter saw is winning the industry over. The saw's remarkably smooth  slide action lets you glide easily--and precisely--through trim cuts, while the  saw's big motor hungrily powers through larger work pieces. Also, thanks to the  well-designed slide, this saw has the miter capacity to handle a two-by-twelve  at 90 degrees and a four-by-four at 45 degrees. You can also miter up to 57  degrees right and 48 degrees left, which comes in handy if you're working on a  custom deck that features some tight angles.Porter-Cable definitely put some time into the details of this saw. The rails  slide underneath the saw's table, instead of above, which ought to better  protect them, especially when you're transporting the saw. The tool also has a  big table that gives plenty of support space for workpieces, making it easier to  hold them securely in place when cutting. There's an electric brake (all miter  saws should have one), and the blade guard retracts smoothly. The D-handle  design makes the saw comfortable to operate with either your right or left hand,  which is convenient considering the wide range of cuts you're likely to make.  The work clamp makes it easy to hold pieces in place, keeping your fingers away  from the blade. We really like how the saw's base can mount on the edge of  two-by-fours, creating a quick job site stand. Very clever.A single onboard wrench makes all the adjustments, including blade changes. The  fence on this Porter-Cable is easily adjusted--in case it gets knocked out of  alignment. It's true, a guy could really rave about this saw for quite a while.  The miter and bevel gauges are great, with embossed marks stamped into stainless  steel, so it'll be just as easy to dial in the exact cut three years into the  future as when you first take the tool out of the box (no chintzy stickers or  attached plates here). The stainless-steel detents won't ever develop slop,  either. Bevels are also easy to set. The three-wing screw lock is sturdy and  holds tight, and there's good tension in the unlocked position--so the motor is  easy to move (it doesn't just flop over) when you're setting bevels.--Jon  Groebner"

Like all Weber grill covers, this one is made of heavy-duty vinyl that resists cracking even in subzero temperatures. It fits Weber 22-1/2-inch kettle grills.--Benjamin Reese"
23524,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",Weber 4261001 Black Genesis Platinum C Propane Gas Grill (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"At first glance, Weber gas grills look like something that might be shot into space or driven in a Formula 1 race rather than the sleek cooking machines they really are. This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis series of grills Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on your patio. The Genesis Platinum-C features a generous 611 square inches of total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000 Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting fuel. Platinum series grills also include a waterless smoker accessory that can be used in conjunction with mesquite or hickory chips to give a smoky edge to your cooking, as well as stainless-steel cooking grates. In place of the lava rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber Platinum grills feature stainless-steel versions of the company's patented Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats. Instead, juices sizzle and smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast.Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's Crossover Ignition System enables you to effortlessly start all three burners, which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the hood; it can also be removed and used as a meat thermometer to ensure a thoroughly cooked meal every time. And you won't need to scramble for seasonings (or recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a separate table while cooking, thanks to several convenient features. In addition to the handy stainless-steel work surface, complete with a stainless-steel towel bar, a wire shelf is situated beneath the grill, enclosed by stainless-steel doors, a feature exclusive to the Platinum-C. In addition, this model features a side burner, rated at 14,000 Btu's per hour, that's perfect for creating a side dish to accompany your perfectly cooked main course.With its lid open, the Genesis Platinum-C measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2 inches wide, and 34 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved, however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which prevent it from moving when you're cooking.  While a grill cover is recommended to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or nests. Best of all, as this grill comes almost entirely assembled out of the box, the anxious griller will be able to have ribs roasting and burgers flipping in no time at all.

24056,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 5371-6 1/2-Inch Magnum Heavy Duty Hammer Drill Kit,"You get two tools in one when you buy this kit. Milwaukee's Magnum hammer drill can be used as a regular drill for boring in wood or metal, or it can be switched over for use as a hammer drill, allowing percussion carbide-bit drilling in concrete and masonry. You can feel the quality of this tool when you hold it--its reinforced nylon resin casing, which is lighter and stronger than metal, offers better heat dissipation and chemical resistance. The machined, keyed, industrial chuck is impressive, too, featuring deep, heavy-duty teeth that up the maximum bite on the bit.Of course, when a hammer drill is used in heavy-duty industrial situations, the brushes wear out quickly; taking this into account, Milwaukee's Magnum drill conveniently comes with a removable brush cartridge system, so you can change brushes in seconds (there are even two extra brushes stored inside). We also liked the Quik-Lok cord set, which makes it easy to switch cord lengths (if you have one of the optional cords). There's also a handy depth guide adjustment that makes it easy to repeat accurate holes. While the dual operation of this drill is a great feature, if you intend to use it primarily for wood and metal work, you may want to consider a drill designed for that purpose; the Magnum, because of its dual-action capability, is larger and heavier than standard drills. But if you're interested in a tool that can handle both applications, we think this is a great choice.--Tim Block"

Ideal for use with compact soil, clay, drought-damaged plots, and surfaces prone to heavy traffic like a soccer field, the aerator extracts plugs of dirt from the earth in 40-inch wide swathes. By pulling out these small plugs, water and oxygen gain more immediate access to plant roots and soil and creates a healthier environment for growing without disease and pest dilemmas. The disposed plugs can be broken up and added to compose for later use. A tractor tows the aerator, allowing users to cover large spans of land in little time.The plug aerator cores with twenty-four heavy gauge galvanized points, heat-treated for greater durability. Six rustproof spools hold the points, with four points on each spool. The points reach 3 inches into the earth, removing 3/4-inch diameter plugs. Spools are affixed to a heavy-duty, 48-inch wide steel tray. Users engage the aerator with an upright lever on top of the tray. The long lever is easily accessible from the tractor seat. Two 10-by-4-inch pneumatic wheels transport the aerator most any terrain. A hitch pin accompanies the aerator for easy tractor hook-up. For the best results, aerate in the spring and late fall.

The Power Plus Sawzall combines the all-around versatility of Milwaukee's standard reciprocating saw with the unencumbered mobility of cordless operation. With a 1-inch length of stroke and a range of 0 to 2,000 spm, it doesn't quite offer the power and smoothness of Milwaukee's corded models, but you'll certainly find it's plenty of tool for all general applications. In fact, the folks at Milwaukee tell us you can cut the top off a car with this tool using only two batteries (we didn't try it). As with Milwaukee's corded reciprocating saws, the blade is reversible, allowing you to cut upside down if need be in tight spaces. We also really like Milwaukee's new timesaving Quik-Lok blade clamp, which lets you change blades quickly without having to use a hex wrench.The Power Plus drill/driver that comes in this kit is the most powerful cordless drill offered by Milwaukee. This drill features two speed ranges, 20 torque adjustments, and an electric brake that makes it ideal for repetitive work. The keyless steel chuck--like all keyless chucks--is handy but does require two hands to tighten it 100%. The kit also includes a work light that delivers three hours of illumination on a single charge. With a 120-degree pivoting head and a battery-heavy bottom, the light is easily set on a flat surface and its beam aimed where you need it. If you're looking for a set of heavy-duty cordless tools that combine quality with value, this combo kit is a terrific choice.--Tim Block"

24787,Industrial & Scientific,"Niagara Cutter D400 High-Speed Steel End Mill, General Purpose, TiN Coated, 4 Flutes, Double Square End, 3/4&quot; Cutting Length, 3/8&quot; Cutting Diameter","The Niagara Cutter D400 TiN-coated high-speed steel double-end square end mill has four flutes, a 30-degree helix angle, and a non-center-cutting design for general-purpose machining on a wide range of materials. Four flutes produce a better finish than fewer flutes. The general-purpose TiN coating combines stability at high temperatures with hardness for wear protection, increasing tool life and performance compared to uncoated end mills. (TiN is suitable for a range of materials, but TiCN or uncoated end mills are recommended for machining aluminum.) High-speed steel (HSS) is a common general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. The double-end design has cutting edges on both ends, allowing a new cutting surface to be substituted when the first shows wear, which doubles the tool&#x2019;s life compared to single-end square end mills. The tool&#x2019;s square end has straight cutting edges that create sharp, unrounded cuts.The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles&#x2019; strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles&#x2019; increased cutting action. The non-center-cutting design is for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, and can also be used for profiling and slotting. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001&#x201D; to -0.000&#x201D;. This tool has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

Some knife lovers will settle for nothing less than chrome vanadium blades, since this special formula of alloyed steel is the &#x201C;original&#x201D; Case blade steel.  Case chrome vanadium blades are known for their edge-holding ability and easy resharpening.  However, they are less resistant to rusting, pitting and discoloration than stainless steel.  We recommend keeping a thin film of oil on the blade to maintain the finish.  This ensures that your knife will be around for future generations to enjoy. About W.R. Case & Sons Cutlery Co. W.R.

It is, especially when you're talking about this handsaw from Shark. The ancient Japanese concept of pulling to cut gives you maximum results from minimum effort. Everything about this Shark is top-notch: the shape of the teeth, thickness, balance and the coordinated angle of the teeth, blade, handle, and blade replacement system. Because these blades cut on the pull rather than the push, the blades can be thinner, lighter and more flexible than regular saw blades, and flexibility means flush cutting. The cut is uniformly accurate, clean and easy to start, and you're left with a super-thin kerf. The blade is nice and wide, so you can fearlessly guide it with just a thumb. Something about the angle of the teeth seems to clear debris better than a standard saw, too. Add to this awesome saw the pry bar that comes with it, and you cannot beat this set. We love the bar for its ultra-sharp chiseled edge and the curve that gets you into the tightest spots. It's certainly the thinnest flat bar we've seen, great for prying off trim and molding with virtually no damage to the surrounding wall or the molding itself. We can imagine putting this to good use as a paint scraper, staple and nail puller, carpet remover, tile remover&#x85; the list goes on and on. We are impressed.--Kris Jensen-Van Heste"

27148,Industrial & Scientific,"Niagara Cutter 33809 High Speed Steel (HSS) Square Nose End Mill, Inch, Weldon Shank, Uncoated (Bright) Finish, Finishing Cut, 37 Degree Helix, 3 Flutes, 3.0625&quot; Overall Length, 0.250&quot; Cutting Diameter, 0.375&quot; Shank Diameter","The Niagara Cutter A337 uncoated high-speed steel square nose end mill has three flutes and a 37-degree helix for milling aluminum and other non-ferrous materials. The 37-degree helix angle gives more support behind the cutting edge than higher angles and offers increased cutting action and chip evacuation compared to the conventional 30-degree helix. It efficiently cuts aluminum and other non-ferrous material, moving material up the spiral and away from the workpiece. The end mill&#x2019;s three flutes remove excess material from the cutting area and provide a third cutting edge to create an improved finish that may eliminate the need for a second finishing cut in some applications. The rounded area behind the cutting edge, called the cylindrical land, stabilizes the tool and smoothes the surface of the workpiece, minimizing tool vibration (chatter) when machining non-ferrous materials. The cutting edge is treated with extra grinding passes, minimizing surface roughness and creating a low-friction surface on the cutting edge to help prevent chips from sticking to the tool.High-speed steel (HSS) is a common general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. With no coating or surface treatment, this uncoated tool can be used on a broad range of material. The tool&#x2019;s square end has straight cutting edges that create sharp, unrounded cuts. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool, so it can be fed into the workpiece like a drill bit. The tool has an eccentric primary relief feature that provides better support behind the cutting edge than a flat relief, reducing tooth breakage in deep cuts. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001"" to -0.000"". The tool has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

They are available in a variety of head styles and materials.Alloy Steel is steel that has been alloyed with other materials to improve overall physical properties.  Steels are designated by a 4 number SAE Steel grade.  The first two digits indicate the primary materials used to form the steel.  The last 2 digits identify the percentage of carbon for the alloy (in hundredths).  Tensile strength ranges for the alloys typically used in these fasteners range from 170,000 to 180,000 psi (pounds per square inch), making these amongst the strongest of materials.Flat head fasteners are designed to fit flush to the surface when used with countersunk holes.  Length is measured from the top of the head.  Hex socket drive systems are driven by hex wrenches or power tools with hexagonal bits.A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Coarse threads are better when working with brittle materials; they are sturdier and are easier to thread and unthread compared to fine.

And thanks to the unique side-grind on each tooth, the blade smoothes work surfaces as it cuts through them. This leaves you with a super-smooth, high-quality finish that doesn't need to be sanded down.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting wood that is 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches thick or when cutting chipboard and plywood that is less than 1-inch thick. The blade can also handle ripping wood and working with laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.116 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis cut-off saw blade's 80 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""crosscut blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening. and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

28707,Tools & Home Improvement,"JET 708634 DC-1200 2 Horsepower 1,200 CFM Vertical Bag Dust Collector, 230 Volt 1 Phase","A great carpenter once referred to sawdust as ""the indomitable scourge silently mounting in woodshops nationwide."" Well, now you can fight back with Jet's 1,200 cfm dust collector. Running a powerful 2-horsepower induction motor on 230 volts, this handy shop tool comes standard with 7.36-cubic-foot bags that collect particles 30 microns and larger. The thickness of the 12-inch steel blower wheel is great for handling larger particle-producing applications. As is standard on most models, two 4-inch dust ports feed into a main 6-inch tube, allowing you to connect it to multiple machines. For convenience, Jet has placed the entire unit on easy-to-roll casters, so it can be moved around the shop when necessary. One unique feature separating Jet's dust collector from the competition is how easily the lower bag can be removed and reattached. The bag is held securely in place by a flexible metal band, so the bag pops in and out without the hassle of cinch straps you'll find on other models. Standing 96 inches tall and pulling 5.34 cubic feet of air, this machine is perfect for medium-to-large shops. A good dust collector, like this one, improves your workplace environment and also extends the life of your tools--two pretty compelling reasons to get one for your shop.--Justin Paul"

It also has a variable-speed selector dial, which is handy, but not really the same as a variable-speed trigger (found on more expensive saws). You do get five orbital-action settings, however, which is great, especially when you want to make faster, more aggressive cuts (many consumer-grade saws offer only an up-and-down stroke).

29194,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",Weber 3251001 Black Genesis Gold B Propane Gas Grill (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"At first glance, Weber gas grills look like something that might be shot into space or driven in a Formula 1 race rather than the sleek cooking machines they really are. This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis series of grills Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on your patio. The Genesis Gold-B features a generous 611 square inches of total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000 Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting fuel. In place of the lava rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber grills feature the company's patented porcelain-enameled Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats. Instead, juices sizzle and smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast.Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's Crossover Ignition System enables you to effortlessly start all three burners, which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the hood; it can also be removed and used as a meat thermometer to ensure a thoroughly cooked meal every time. And you won't need to scramble for seasonings (or recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a separate table while cooking, thanks to several convenient features. In addition to the two handy work surfaces on either side of the unit, a wire condiment basket hangs along the front of the grill, keeping condiments, spices, marinades, or other barbecue necessities close at hand. A wire shelf is situated beneath the grill and stretches the length of the unit, and three wire tool hooks hang below the work surface, ready for your spatula, meat fork, and basting brush. Weber's propane gas grills also come with a 20-pound LP tank and a precision fuel gauge.With its lid open, the Genesis Gold-B measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2 inches wide, and 33 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved, however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which prevent it from moving when you're cooking. While a grill cover is recommended to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or nests. Best of all, as this grill comes almost entirely assembled out of the box, the anxious griller will be able to have ribs roasting and burgers flipping in no time at all. Manufacturer's limited lifetime warranty.--Benjamin Reese"
29201,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",Weber Baby Q (Q 100) Portable Gas Grill (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"It's hard to believe that a grill just 14 inches tall could offer 189 square inches of cooking space, but it's true. Weber's super-portable Baby Q gas grill features 8,500-BTUs for quickly barbecuing burgers, steaks, poultry and seafood. A push-button ignition means easy, reliable lighting on the road or at that remote campsite. The grill is equipped with an infinitely adjustable burner valve and high-quality regulator. A sturdy, reinforced nylon grill frame offers optimal stability for those larger cookouts. A cast aluminum lid and body stand up to the occasional drop off the tailgate, yet are light weight enough for easy transfer from trunk to picnic table. The grill also features a large, heat-resistant lid handle and a porcelain-enameled cast iron cooking grate.  The Baby Q is fueled by a standard 14.1 ounce propane cylinder (sold separately).--Brian Olson"
29208,Industrial & Scientific,"Niagara Cutter RTM447 Cobalt Steel End Mill, Fine Pitch Rougher, TiN Coated, 3 Flutes, Chamfer End, 5/8&quot; Cutting Length, 1/4&quot; Cutting Diameter","The Niagara Cutter RTM447 TiN-coated cobalt steel fine-pitch rougher end mill has three flutes, a 36-degree helix angle for milling difficult-to-machine materials, and includes chip-breaking cutting edges that remove more material in less time than conventional end mills to support heavier cuts at higher speeds. The fine-pitch tooth design is suitable for machining dense materials such as high-temperature alloys. The 36-degree helix angle provides more support behind the cutting edge than higher angles and increases cutting action and chip evacuation compared to the standard 30-degree helix. It efficiently cuts difficult-to-machine material moving it up the spiral and away from the workpiece. The end mill has three flutes to optimize the feed and cut rate.Rougher end mills are special-purpose tools whose chip-breaking cutting edges create small chips for heavy cuts and remove more material in less time than conventional end mills with minimal vibration (chatter). The end mill produces a rough finish that can be smoothed by a second finishing cut. The general-purpose TiN coating combines stability at high temperatures with hardness for wear protection, increasing tool life and performance compared to uncoated end mills. The cobalt steel substrate can be run at faster speeds and stays sharp longer than high-speed steel tools, while offering resistance to heat and abrasion. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool so it can be fed straight into the workpiece like a drill bit. The tool&#x2019;s square end creates sharp unrounded cuts and has a corner chamfer on the cutting edges to provide more strength than standard square end tools in applications where cutting forces are high. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.005&#x201D; to -0.000"". This tool has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills cutting mills and saws the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at two facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production an essential benefit for customers in a variety of industries especially aerospace and automotive."

Here's a stand that's worthy of those little dynamos. It's preset for several models of Makita, Hitachi, DeWalt, and Delta, but it's easily adapted for saws with tops up to 24-1/2 inches deep and 27 inches wide. This is by far the sturdiest benchtop accessory we've seen, with the best array of options. At a great working height of 34-1/2 inches, you'll increase your rip capacity to a burly 27 inches and won't have to call your next-door neighbor anymore to give you a hand when you're cutting sheet goods. The fence is tubular steel with an adjustable magnified hairline indicator for superior readability. Something we noticed and really liked on this stand was that the front edge sits just a bit lower than the saw table, so stock slides smooth as silk without catching. The optional add-ons are great, too: the PM2715XL extension adds a router table to your saw and increases rip capacity to an awesome 49 inches. An outfeed table is available, too. And should you need to, the saw removes easily and the stand folds flat for storage and portability. A winner all the way around.--Kris Jensen-Van Heste"

To ensure that the highest quality products meet the toughest design standards, Freud owns and operates six manufacturing facilities in Western Europe. Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain carbide with titanium, called TiCo -- a combination of titanium and cobalt. Freud develops different types of carbide for each application to maximize the cutting life and performance of the tool; and Freud also operates one of the most modern product development research centers in Europe.

The advanced thin kerf design removes less material -- thereby reducing the strain on your equipment and increasing the life of your saw. The slim design requires less cutting power from both you and the saw, making it ideal for underpowered saws. A Silver I.C.E. coating on all Freud TK blades helps reduce friction, heat build-up and gumming, thus extending the life of the blade by as much as 50 percent.About this Avanti BladeThe Freud 10-inch 50-tooth thin kerf combination saw blade features a unique-Tooth design suitable for multiple cutting and ripping tasks. Each set of 5 teeth is separated by a large gullet, which provides the chip removal space required while ripping -- and the close grouping of teeth within the set provides the smaller bite size required when crosscutting. For easy use and added precision, the blades also feature an anti-kickback design, and tri-metal brazing for impact resistance. The blade has expansion slots that are strategically placed to allow for blade-body expansion from centrifugal force, and thermal expansion during actual use. The slots are used to prevent air turbulence and eliminate vibration. This blade boasts a Silver I.C.E. coating resist corrosion and buildup, and officer twice as much heat resistance and life than conventional uncoated blades.ApplicationsThis thin kerf saw blade requires less cutting power from the user and the saw, allowing more control over the cut for safer operation.

It features 48 teeth with alternating top bevels and TiCo high-density carbide tips, negative hook angles for maximum control, and Freud's insulating, Perma-SHIELD coating.LU91R008 Thin Kerf Sliding Compound Miter Saw BladeAt a Glance:Ideal for crosscutting materials 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-SHIELD coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter8 1/2""Teeth48 ATBArbor5/8""Kerf (K).090Plate (P).071Depth of CutNegative Hook Angleminimizes climbing for better controlThin Kerfrequires less power and allows for faster feed rateNegative Hook Angle for Fine Finishes with Sliding Miter SawsThis thin kerf blade's 48-tooth alternating-top-bevel (ATB) configuration features teeth that face both left and right. The blade's teeth also feature five-degree, negative hook angles, which helps prevent the blade from being too aggressive. This configuration also works to push your work piece down and towards the fence of your saw for smooth, accurate feeding. And because thin-kerf blades remove less material than standard carbide blades, they require less horsepower to produce smooth, accurate results when cutting.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting wood that is 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it also performs well in laminate. This blade can also rip wood or be used with chipboard and plywood, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.090 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis thin-kerf saw blade's 48 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""crosscut blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

30763,Tools & Home Improvement,Delta 36-240 Sidekick 10-Inch Compound Miter saw without Stand,"With easy portability and adjustment features built for speed, Delta's Sidekick 10-inch sliding compound miter saw makes a great cutting partner. Weighing in at only 56 pounds, the Sidekick is definitely designed for the job site, rather than the woodshop. Unlike other saws in its class, the Sidekick's entire base pivots--a distinctive feature that surely helped Delta build such a lightweight saw. The saw's dual horizontal rods are located underneath the base, too, which certainly protects the saw's slide and also seems to give the saw a lower, more stable center of balance. The ergonomic D-shaped handle is comfortable for either left- or right-handed use. The cam-action miter lock--always a good idea with miter saws--is definitely quicker and easier to use than the old traditional screw locks.This saw only bevels to the left, however, and setting the miter gauge requires more effort than we'd like. The scale is set from behind the fence, which means you have to lean over the saw a bit to set your angle. It isn't a hassle, exactly, but it might be more effort than finish carpenters--who have to dial in exact angles all day long--would like. However, anyone would appreciate the stock stops, which extend up to 59 inches down the stand. As is standard, Delta's Sidekick has positive stops set at 0, 22-1/2, 31.62, and 45 degrees. Spinning a 10-inch blade at 5,000 rpm, the Sidekick cuts widths to 11-1/2 inches at 90 degrees and 8 inches at 45 degrees. It's a good, solid saw, all in all, especially for contractors who want big cutting capacity and who are tired of lugging heavy compound miter saws around.--Justin Paul"

30795,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 6176-20 15 Amp 14-Inch Abrasive Cutoff Machine,"Milwaukee's rugged and durable cut-off machine has a heavy cast-iron base. All it takes is one cut to realize this is a quality piece of machinery. We cut a bundle of metal two-by-fours with no problem at all. Letting the blade do the work, we made smooth, accurate cuts in angle iron, pipe, and rebar. Individual features make a big difference. The Milwaukee sports a 5-inch-square capacity, which is larger than most other saws. An onboard wrench is conveniently located on the base (no need to guess where you put it). The saw's arm locks down to protect the blade during transport, and there's a conveniently located carrying handle. (While the saw, at 47 pounds, is portable, we wouldn't want to tote it all over the place.) Though initially we thought the base seemed narrow, once set in place, the saw held surprisingly steady. The cast-iron base rests on four rubber feet, one of which is cleverly located below the back of the blade where it's protected from sparks--smart thinking in the design area. The verdict is simple: this cut-off machine earns our highest praise.--Dori Anvinson"

The MultiPro rotary tool is the handful of power behind a thousand uses, with supreme control and ergonomic comfort and, truth be told, its tremendous fun to use.  Its five speed sets range from 5,000 to a router-like 35,000 rpm, and combined with a seemingly endless array of  bits and attachments, you can carve, grind, polish, trim, sand, cut a wide range of material, shape, clean, remove grout, smooth, drill, rout, sculpt, sharpen, engrave, strip finishes &#x96; kind of like being a superhero with gadgets that never end.The secret ingredient is the speed. With a bit moving at 35,000 rpm, you don&#x92;t need to lean into the job at all; on the contrary, we found a light touch to be the most effective, and the tool does the work for you. Control is superb, thanks to a comfortable housing and excellent balance whether you&#x92;re doing detail work with a pencil-like grip or grasping the tool like a tennis racquet. It&#x92;s light as a feather at just about a pound, so even working at shoulder height or above is no chore.  Bit change is fast and easy; the collet locks with a button and the wrench stores on board. This set comes with 10 bits to get you started, but have a look at other accessory sets too, because once you get this Dremel in hand, it&#x92;s addictive. You&#x92;ll want to pick up the flex shaft and right-angle attachments for cramped quarters, add on a router-type base, and maybe even get the stand that turns the tool into a mini drill press. If you&#x92;ve never had a rotary tool, you absolutely can&#x92;t go wrong with this one, and if you&#x92;re upgrading from a single- or dual-speed model, you&#x92;ll love it.--Kris Jensen-Van Heste"

32807,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 5377-6 1/2-Inch Magnum Hammer Drill Kit with Keyless Chuck,"You get two tools in one when you buy this kit. Milwaukee's Magnum hammer drill can be used as a regular drill for boring in wood or metal, or it can be switched over for use as a hammer drill, allowing percussion carbide-bit drilling in concrete and masonry. You can feel the quality of this tool when you hold it--its reinforced nylon resin casing, which is lighter and stronger than metal, offers better heat dissipation and chemical resistance. We found the convenient keyless chuck on this model to have an impressively tough grip, even in the toughest concrete drilling applications.Of course, when a hammer drill is used in heavy-duty industrial situations, the brushes wear out quickly. Taking this into account, Milwaukee's Magnum drill conveniently comes with a removable brush cartridge system so you can change brushes in seconds (there are even two extra brushes stored inside). We also liked the Quik-Lok cord set, which makes it easy to switch cord lengths (if you have one of the optional cords). There's also a handy depth guide adjustment that makes it easy to repeat accurate holes. While the dual operation of this drill is a great feature, if you intend to use it primarily for wood and metal work, you may want to consider a drill designed for that purpose; the Magnum, because of its dual-action capability, is larger and heavier than standard drills. But if you're interested in a tool that can handle both applications, we think this is a great choice.--Tim Block"

33268,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 0512-25 14.4 Volt 1/2-Inch Drill Kit with Flashlightight,"The Power Plus battery pack is one of the highlights of Milwaukee's 14.4-volt cordless drill. The battery is reversible, which helps balance the tool for the user and also makes it easier to get into tight spots. The adjustable clutch is easy to use and gives you two speed ranges to choose from: low gear for more power (maximum: 280 in./lb. of torque) when driving screws and high gear for more speed when drilling. There are also 19 different superprecise clutch positions--so you can match the torque to the application, minimizing the risk of stripping screws or breaking off heads. The thin, soft-grip handle seems to absorb some of the vibrations, making the drill comfortable both to hold and use. The 1/2-inch keyless chuck is a bonus feature, holding a larger bit than most of the 3/8-inch competition in the 14.4 market. The forward/reverse function takes some getting used to: it's a switch, as opposed to the more common two-sided buttons you find on most other brands, and, depending on hand size, can be a bit tricky to reach with your trigger hand. The kit also includes a handy light with a flexible head, so in the odd case you have to work in the dark, you've got a good light to take with you. This is a great tool for either the professional or the serious do-it-yourselfer. Excellent work, Milwaukee.--Dori Anvinson"

33485,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",Weber 2003 Model 3290001 Genesis Gold C Propane Gas Grill (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"At first glance, Weber gas grills look like something that might be shot into space or driven in a Formula 1 race rather than the sleek cooking machines they really are. This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis series of grills, Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on your patio. The Genesis Gold C features a generous 611 square inches of total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000 Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting fuel. The Genesis Gold C also features a side burner, rated at 10,000 Btu's per hour, that is perfect for creating a side dish to accompany your perfectly cooked main course. In place of the lava rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber grills feature the company's patented Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats.  Instead, juices sizzle and smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast.Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's  Crossover ignition system enables you to effortlessly start all three burners,  which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer  included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the  double-walled stainless-steel hood; it can also be removed and used as a meat  thermometer to ensure a thoroughly cooked meal every time. And you won't need to  scramble for seasonings (or recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a  separate table while cooking, thanks to several convenient features. In addition  to the handy work surface on one side of the unit, a wire condiment basket hangs  along the front of the grill, keeping condiments, spices, marinades, or other  barbecue necessities close at hand. A wire shelf is situated beneath the grill  and stretches the length of the unit, and three wire tool hooks hang below the  work surface, ready for your spatula, meat fork, and basting brush. Weber  natural gas grills also come with a 12-foot quick-disconnect hose.With its lid open, the Genesis Gold C measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2 inches  wide, and 33 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved,  however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which  prevent it from moving when you're cooking. While a grill cover is recommended  to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor  storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special  spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or  nests.This grill features Weber's Stop Watch engineering. Now it takes approximately  10 minutes to assemble your grill with no more than eight fasteners and a single  tool. Weber even throws in the tool.

There are three rugged steel infeed rollers that grab hold of the stock for you, paired with three rubber outfeed rollers that won&#x92;t mar your piece.

Yes, the table surface. Instead of the cutterhead coming down to the work, the work moves up to the stationary cutterhead.

The depth scale is clear and legible, marked in increments of 1/16-inch. We like the sturdy return rollers mounted on top, giving you a great place to rest the stock and giving your arms and back a break on the trip back to the infeed side.This is a beautifully made machine, with the fit and finish you&#x92;d expect in this price category, form the one-piece welded base to the serrated infeed rollers and the glass-like table surface.

This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis series of grills Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on your patio. The Genesis Gold-C features a generous 611 square inches of total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000 Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting fuel. The Genesis Gold-C also features a side burner, rated at 10,000 Btu's per hour, that's perfect for creating a side dish to accompany your perfectly cooked main course. In place of the lava rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber grills feature the company's patented porcelain-enameled Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats. Instead, juices sizzle and smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast.Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's Crossover Ignition System enables you to effortlessly start all three burners, which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the hood; it can also be removed and used as a meat thermometer to ensure a thoroughly cooked meal every time. And you won't need to scramble for seasonings (or recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a separate table while cooking, thanks to several convenient features. In addition to the handy work surface on one side of the unit, a wire condiment basket hangs along the front of the grill, keeping condiments, spices, marinades, or other barbecue necessities close at hand. A wire shelf is situated beneath the grill and stretches the length of the unit, and three wire tool hooks hang below the work surface, ready for your spatula, meat fork, and basting brush. Weber natural gas grills also come with a 12-foot quick-disconnect hose.With its lid open, the Genesis Gold-C measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2 inches wide, and 33 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved, however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which prevent it from moving when you're cooking. While a grill cover is recommended to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or nests. Best of all, as this grill comes almost entirely assembled out of the box, the anxious griller will be able to have ribs roasting and burgers flipping in no time at all.

34959,Industrial & Scientific,"Niagara Cutter SB470 High-Speed Steel End Mill, General Purpose, Regular Length, TiCN Coated, 4 Flutes, Ball End, 1-1/4&quot; Cutting Length, 5/8&quot; Cutting Diameter","The Niagara Cutter SB470 TiCN-coated high-speed steel ball nose end mill has a 30-degree helix angle for general-purpose machining on a variety of materials. The number of flutes varies; fewer flutes provide better chip-carrying capacity, while more flutes produce a finer finish. The TiCN coating lubricates the end mill for high-temperature stability, and offers increased hardness and greater abrasion resistance than uncoated or TiN-coated tools. High-speed steel (HSS) is a common, general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials.The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles&#x2019; strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles&#x2019; increased cutting action.  The tool&#x2019;s ball nose creates contoured surfaces, where sharp corners are not required, while the center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool that support profiling and slotting. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001"" to -0.000"". The end mill has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

35167,Tools & Home Improvement,Makita LS1212 12-Inch Dual Rail Slide Compound Miter Saw with Carbide-Tipped Blade,"Riding on a horizontal double-rail system, Makita's 12-inch dual sliding compound miter saw delivers all the cutting capacity a miter saw can give. The saw crosscuts up to 12-1/4 inches, handling two-by-twelves with ease. With a 3-7/8-inch maximum depth miter cut, the saw also cuts four-by-four material in one pass--a feature deck builders, in particular, will appreciate. Both rails are self-cleaning and ride on linear ball bearings. The horizontal rail design also seems to give this saw some extra stability, a feature that's particularly important in a 12-inch saw that bevels to 45 degrees both ways. Makita's saw has a vertical grip design with a thumb-activated safety switch and a paddle trigger, and while the vertical design might be slightly less ergonomic than the horizontal D-handle, it does allow you to use the saw comfortably with either hand. Plus, the paddle grip makes squeezing the trigger easy no matter how you're holding the handle.The saw's nine positive stops make it easy to lock in common miters, too, and they're deep-cast into the body of the saw, so it's hard to imagine they'd ever develop slop. The miter lock on this saw has an older screw-handle design, which is a little more time-consuming than a new (more expensive) cam-lock design. We really like the electric brake, though, a user-friendly feature that makes a big difference, especially when a job requires a lot of constant, repetitive cuts. The pivot fence adjusts for supporting large stock and flips back for bevel cuts. The saw also comes with a well-designed work clamp that lets you make precision cuts on small pieces without having to get your fingers too close to the blade. Like most sliders, this saw features a depth-stop mechanism in case you have to make a few quick dado cuts on a job site. And, for home shop users, this saw has the added option of a release safety button that pulls out and locks the saw off.--Jon Groebner"

Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility."

35619,Tools & Home Improvement,Freud LU85R015 15-Inch 108 Tooth ATB Ultimate Cut-Off Saw Blade with 1-Inch Arbor and PermaShield Coating,"The 15-inch Freud LU85R015 Ultimate Cut-Off Saw Blade delivers fast, accurate crosscuts and leaves glass-smooth finishes that eliminate the need for sanding. Featuring 108 teeth with alternating bevels and TiCo high-density carbide tips, a unique side-grind setup that polishes material as you cut through it, and Freud's insulating, Perma-SHIELD coating, this blade is built to deliver top results over the long haul.LU85R015 Ultimate Cut-Off Saw BladeAt a Glance:Ideal for smooth crosscuts in materials that are 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-Shield coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter15""Teeth108 ATBArbor1""Kerf (K).136Plate (P).118Depth of CutUnique Side Grindpolishes the material to produce a superior finishLaser-Cut Anti-Vibration Slotsdrastically reduce vibration and sideways movement in the cut extending blade life, and giving a crisp, flawless finishATB Teeth with Side-Grinding for Glass-Smooth FinishesThis cut-off blade's 108-tooth alternating-top-bevel (ATB) configuration features teeth that face both left and right--a versatile setup that's ideal for crosscuts in hard- and softwood, as well as general use. And thanks to the unique side-grind on each tooth, the blade smoothes work surfaces as it cuts through them. This leaves you with a super-smooth, high-quality finish that doesn't need to be sanded down.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting wood that is 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches thick or when cutting chipboard and plywood that is less than 1-inch thick. The blade can also handle ripping wood and working with laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.136 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis cut-off saw blade's 108 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""crosscut blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

35688,Tools & Home Improvement,Hitachi CR13VA 11 Amp Reciprocating Saw with Electronic Variable Speed,"Hitachi doesn't just make televisions and consumer electronics--they're also at the forefront of the power tool world, and their new electronic variable-speed  reciprocating saw is a good example of why.

The powerful 11 amp motor takes on the densest materials with ease--and, with the saw's unique ""swing"" action, it cuts faster than saws with more conventional orbital action. Another feature we like on this saw is the blade removal system, a keyless, one-hand blade clamp that's quick and doesn't break your thumb in the process (we wish the blade lodged a little deeper into the clamp, though; it rattled a bit in tougher woods). On the whole, this is a solid saw with an accurate electronic variable-speed apparatus in the trigger.--Michael Shilling"

The Summit 650 stands 60 inches tall, 79 inches wide, and 31 inches deep and features an input of 75,000 Btu's per hour. A brand-new burner system was designed for the Summit series: burner controls are on the front of the grill, which allows room for six burners, so all 636 square inches of the primary cooking area heat evenly and thoroughly. The Crossover Ignition System allows you to light all burners in succession with the push of one button. And the Summit 650's expanded total cooking surface of 742 square inches makes it easier to use various cooking styles: direct grilling for steaks and hamburgers or indirect cooking for roasting turkey or prime rib.The Summit 650 also has restaurant-grade enhancements, such as a commercial-grade thermometer and three heavy cooking grates made from large-diameter stainless-steel rods robot-welded for incredible strength. The hood, made of lustrous stainless steel, will never rust, peel, or fade because it's baked on at 1,600 degrees, and its brushed stainless-steel handle stays as cool as it looks. Patented Flavorizer bars, made from heavy-gauge stainless steel, eliminate flare-ups and impart a rich flavor by turning meat juice into smoke. If you're serving ribs and salmon, you'll appreciate the Steam-N-Chips smoker that comes with this grill: it combines aromatic smoke from mesquite or hickory chips with steam to give your feasts a smokehouse flavor. Plus, you can cook veggies, create scrumptious side dishes, and reheat with Weber's 106-square-inch stainless-steel warming rack. Use the 12-foot quick-disconnect hose to get your first savory Summit cookouts started in a hurry--connecting your gas supply is, literally, a snap.

36107,Tools & Home Improvement,Milwaukee 6509-21 Variable Speed Sawzall with Quik-Lok Blade Clamp,"For years, Milwaukee's Sawzalls have been valued for their outstanding ability to cut through almost any material: wood, nail-embedded wood, steel, cast iron, aluminum, brass, drywall, composition materials, hard rubber, cement, brick, plaster, and fiberglass. This model is particularly popular among drywall contractors who prefer its shallow 3/4-inch stroke, but it's a good all-purpose choice for either the professional contractor or do-it-yourselfer who is busy with standard demolition work. It features variable-speed control (from 0 to 2,400 spm) for efficient cutting over a wide range of materials and applications. The blade's reversible, too, which allows you to cut upside down in confined spaces. (More expensive models feature orbital actions for faster cutting.) For those of you who've grown up with Sawzalls, you'll appreciate the addition of the handy Quik-Lok blade clamp, which lets you change blades quickly without having to use a hex wrench; this feature is especially convenient when you're cutting hard materials such as steel, a situation in which blades break frequently. You'll still have to adjust the pivot shoe manually, however, with screws.Before you buy a reciprocating saw, you should consider the user fatigue resulting from the saw's inherent vibration. If the saw will be put to continued use, think about stepping up to a model designed to minimize vibration. But if you're looking for the standard, look no further. Milwaukee's Sawzall is an excellent choice for job site or home improvement projects; a staple in most contractors' toolboxes, it boasts a solid reputation for long-lasting dependability.--Tim Block"

It's ideal for working with hard- or softwoods that are 3/4 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it can be used in gang-rip operations. This versatile blade handles crosscuts with chipboard, plywood, or laminate, and can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.169 kerf.The extra-large, flat teeth featured on this blade leave a smooth, splinter-free finish that eliminates the need for sanding and jointing. This large-tooth design also allows the blade to be safely sharpened more times, prolonging the life of the blade and saving you money. And the large gullets between these teeth ensure easy chip removal.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis heavy-duty rip saw blade's 30 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""ripping blend."" This blend offers a mix of improved density, hardness, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that's ideally matched to the demands of ripping large quantities of thick, hard wood.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--once again, saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

36986,Tools & Home Improvement,Delta 36-225 10-Inch Compound Miter Saw,"This 10-inch compound miter saw from Delta is a sturdy, well-balanced, smooth-cutting saw perfect for use on the job site or in a small shop. Its safety-conscious design includes an electric brake, a see-through retracting blade guard, and a dust and chip collection system. The blade tilts 45 degrees to the left, and the table pivots a full 45 degrees in both directions. This saw has a maximum bite of 1-3/4 by 4 inches when set to a full 45-by-45-degree compound cut (just enough for two-by-fours). It's also capable of through cuts on four-by-fours and two-by-sixes at straight 90-degree crosscuts. Delta offers another 10-inch compound miter saw--the 36-220--at a slightly lower price, but that model has a smaller bite and lacks the comfortable horizontal handle of this one.Other compound miter saws (including a 12-inch model and a sliding saw from Delta) offer a bigger bite, but considering the exceptionally good price on this model, it's hard to find another saw that offers as much value. The 36-225 is a little heavier and more challenging to move around a job site than some competing portable saws, but its weight is due to Delta's solid construction, and the tool has a level of stability and accuracy we think is worth the extra heft. Delta priced this saw to attract home users, but they built it to withstand the rigors of professional use. This is an excellent saw for home shops, or for job site use, and its price certainly can't be beat.--Brian Trinen"

37319,Tools & Home Improvement,Bosch 1618 1-3/4-Horsepower D-Handle Router,"This review refers to the new model of this tool. This is a reconditioned power  tool. Reconditioned generally means that the tool has been returned to the manufacturer,  who brings the tool back to like-new condition. Some tools may contain cosmetic  blemishes. Reconditioned tools come with the same warranty as their new  counterparts.Bosch recently introduced routers that it claims have the highest power-to-weight ratio in  the industry. We believe them. The 1618B is a member of Bosch's new Magnesium line.  This router features a stout 11-amp, 1-3/4-horsepower motor coupled with an  all-magnesium base and housing. The result is a lightweight, well-balanced, and  smooth-operating machine that offers fast results in demanding applications. The  D-handle provides excellent control--especially when reaching and turning on and  off--and the auxiliary handle reverses, which is handy.Bosch engineers are very proud of what they call the ""precision centering system,"" which  makes the router bit track at true center. It's an important feature for multiple-pass  applications like jig cutting, and fine woodworkers will particularly appreciate it. Ease of  height adjustment is a way of measuring quality in routers, and Bosch has come up with a  system that works as well as any we've tested. A large flip lever releases the motor for  adjusting. Rather than twisting as the height changes, the motor raises and drops in a  straight path. The result is a simple and smooth-working course-adjust that couples with  an efficient microadjust to make fine-tuning the depth of cut easy and accurate.  Removing the motor from the base is a similar operation: simply release the flip lever,  depress the course-adjustment lever, slide the motor out until it stops, then turn the motor  counterclockwise and pull. It couldn't be easier, and there's no thumbscrew to wrestle  with. Anyone who switches bases frequently will appreciate this design.The collet is self-releasing, which means there's no need to tap the spindle to change bits,  and the collet depth is 13/16 of an inch, a few 16ths deeper than that of DeWalt or  Porter-Cable--one more weapon in Bosch's battle for a truly centered bit.--Mark  McDonald"

The cobalt steel substrate can be run at faster speeds and stays sharp longer than high-speed steel tools, while offering resistance to heat and abrasion; this tool has no coating or surface treatment.Rougher end mills are special-purpose tools whose chip-breaking cutting edges create small chips for heavy cuts and remove more material in less time than conventional end mills, with minimal vibration (chatter). The 30-degree helix angle balances lower angles&#x2019; strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles&#x2019; increased cutting action. The tool&#x2019;s square end creates sharp, unrounded cuts and has a corner chamfer on the cutting edges to provide more strength than standard square end tools in applications where cutting forces are high. The non-center-cutting design is for applications such as peripheral milling. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.003&#x201D; to -0.000"" for cutting diameters 1&#x201D; or under; +0.006&#x201D; to -0.000&#x201D; for cutting diameters over 1&#x201D;. The end mill has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool&#x2019;s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive."

37797,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",La Crosse Technology WT-967SML Atomic Digital Watch with Stretch Band,"Be aware of the exact time on the go or at home with the WT-967S atomic digital watch from La Crosse Technology. With its built-in antenna, the watch receives radio signals from the NIST WWVB Atomic Clock in Fort Collins, Colorado and regularly resets the time and date according to these transmissions. Likewise, the watch automatically adjusts for daylight savings time.The watch features a 6-1/4-inch-by-13/16-inch stretch band for flexibility and comfort. Crafted in metal and plastic, the band fits wrists measuring up to 8-3/4 inches around. The silver-finished plastic watch case is water resistant to 100 feet, and protects from shocks incurred by normal circumstances. On the 13/16-inch-by-1/2-inch LCD screen, the watch conveys the time in black 3/16-inch digits, displayed in either 12- or 24-hour format. Hours after noon are distinguished by a PM indication. The LCD also relates the month, date, and day of the week. To set the time, the user presses the time zone button on the side of the watch to select the proper zone from the twenty-five available settings. The watch searches automatically for a signal from the WWVB station hourly to obtain the exact time and date for that time zone. Upon successful communication, a radio tower icon appears on the screen. The watch offers a manual transmission-seek function. In regions that do not practice daylight savings, the auto DST feature can be turned off. A 3V CR1620 lithium battery comes installed for an estimated two years of power; an indicator notifies of a low battery. A limited one-year warranty covers this item. The watch case measures 1-7/16 inches long by 1-11/16 inches wide by 7/16 inches high."

37859,Office Products,Fellowes S70C-2 Confetti-Cut Shredder with Basket,"The S70C-2 shredder from Fellowes is perfect for your home or office. The S70C-2 can handle up to seven sheets of standard bond paper and, at 9 inches, has a wider entry than many shredders. However, the stamped steel blades of the cutting mechanism are not made to handle staples and paper clips.Two switches operate the S70C-2. The on/off switch is located on the side of the cutting mechanism, and the operating mode switch is on the top of the machine. When you are ready to shred, place the S70C-2 in one of three modes: on, reverse, or automatic on/off. When the shredder is in the ""on"" position, the blades shred continuously. Reverse mode helps unclog the cutting blades during a paper jam. The automatic on/off mode shreds only when paper touches a sensor on the blades; it automatically stops when shredding is complete.The S70C-2 shredder includes a heavy-duty 5.5-gallon wastebasket. The blade mechanism can be comfortably lifted and set aside for cleaning or paper removal. If the machine is not properly placed on the waste stand, an interlock switch prevents the cutters from operating until the main unit is properly adjusted.The S70C-2 shredder features cross-cut operation for greater security and waste reduction. This type of cut produces smaller pieces of paper, but may also increase the risk of paper jams. To avoid a jam, empty the waste bin frequently. Using the reverse feature and periodically oiling the steel blades also helps keep the S60C in prime condition."

This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis  series of grills, Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking  state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on  your patio. The Genesis Platinum C features a generous 611 square inches of  total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and  a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000  Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting  fuel. Platinum series grills also include a waterless smoker accessory that can  be used in conjunction with mesquite or hickory chips to give a smoky edge to  your cooking, as well as stainless-steel cooking grates. In place of the lava  rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber  Platinum grills feature stainless-steel versions of the company's patented  Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats. Instead, juices sizzle and  smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous  flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast.Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's  Crossover ignition system enables you to effortlessly start all three burners,  which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer  included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the hood;  it can also be removed and used as a meat thermometer to ensure a thoroughly  cooked meal every time. And you won't need to scramble for seasonings (or  recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a separate table while cooking,  thanks to several convenient features. In addition to the double-walled  stainless-steel hood and handy stainless-steel work surface, complete with a  stainless-steel towel bar, a wire shelf is situated beneath the grill, enclosed  by stainless-steel doors, a feature exclusive to the Platinum C. In addition,  this model features a side burner, rated at 14,000 Btu's per hour, that is  perfect for creating a side dish to accompany your perfectly cooked main course.  With its lid open, the Genesis Platinum C measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2  inches wide, and 34 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved,  however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which  prevent it from moving when you're cooking. While a grill cover is recommended  to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor  storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special  spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or  nests.This grill features Weber's Stop Watch engineering. Now it takes approximately  10 minutes to assemble your grill with no more than eight fasteners and a single  tool. Weber even throws in the tool.

Its alternating top bevel teeth feature thick TiCo high-density carbide tips designed to last. And thanks to Freud's Perma-SHIELD coating, which reduces friction to prevent heat buildup, it pulls less than traditional blades and allows for more powerful cutting.LU88R010 Thin Kerf Fine Finish Crosscut Saw BladeAt a Glance:Ideal for crosscutting hard- or softwood that's 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-SHIELD coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter10""Teeth60 ATBArbor5/8""Kerf (K).090Plate (P).071Depth of CutThin Kerfreduces waste and feeds easierPositive Hook Angleproduce a smoother cut and allow for a faster feed rateThin-Kerf and ATB Teeth for Fine Finishes with Underpowered SawsA versatile blade that delivers the fine finish you need for decorative moldings and other precision work, this thin-kerf crosscut saw blade offers a configuration with 60 alternating-top- bevel (ATB) teeth and positive hook angles. This means it provides you with smoother cuts, and it can handle fast feed rates.It's ideal for crosscutting hard- or softwoods that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it also provides good results when cutting plywood and chipboard or when ripping wood. The blade can also handle laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.090 kerf.Plus, because this thin-kerf blade removes less material than standard carbide blades, it wastes less material and requires less horsepower to produce smooth, clean results.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis crosscutting saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""crosscut blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

Featuring 96 teeth with alternating bevels and TiCo high-density carbide tips, a unique side-grind setup that polishes material as you cut through it, and Freud's insulating Perma-SHIELD coating, this blade is built to deliver top results over the long haul.LU85R012 Ultimate Cut-Off Saw BladeAt a Glance:Ideal for smooth crosscuts in materials that are 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-Shield coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter12""Teeth96 ATBArbor1""Kerf (K).116Plate (P).098Depth of CutUnique Side Grindpolishes the material to produce a superior finishLaser-Cut Anti-Vibration Slotsdrastically reduce vibration and sideways movement in the cut extending blade life, and giving a crisp, flawless finishATB Teeth with Side-Grinding for Glass-Smooth FinishesThis cut-off blade's 96-tooth alternating-top-bevel (ATB) configuration features teeth that face both left and right--a versatile setup that's ideal for crosscuts in hard- and softwood, as well as general use. And thanks to the unique side-grind on each tooth, the blade smoothes work surfaces as it cuts through them. This leaves you with a super-smooth, high-quality finish that doesn't need to be sanded down.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting wood that is 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches thick or when cutting chipboard and plywood that is less than 1-inch thick. The blade can also handle ripping wood and working with laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.116 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis cut-off saw blade's 96 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""crosscut blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

40679,Tools & Home Improvement,Freud LU87R010 10-Inch 24-Tooth FTG Thin Kerf Ripping Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch Arbor and PermaShield Coating,"The 10-inch Freud LU87R010 Thin Kerf Rip Saw Blade makes quick work of ripping operations in hard- and softwood. It features 24 flat, oversized teeth with thick TiCo high-density carbide tips designed to last, in addition to Freud's Perma-SHIELD coating, which reduces friction to prevent heat buildup. Plus, since it's a thin-kerf blade, it wastes less material and continues to cut cleanly when used with underpowered saws.LU87R010 Thin Kerf Rip Saw BladeAt a Glance:Ideal for ripping hard- or softwood that's 3/4 to 2-3/4 inches thickThick, heavy-duty plate and anti-vibration designTough Perma-SHIELD coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter10""Teeth24 FLATArbor5/8""Kerf (K).94Plate (P).71""Depth of CutThin Kerfallows for faster feed rate and reduced wastePositive Hook Anglefor fast cutting and easy feeding in ripping applicationsLarge-Tooth, Thin-Kerf Blade Ideal for Low-Horsepower SawsThis rip saw blade is ideally suited to ripping hard- and softwoods, and it also delivers strong results when crosscutting wood or working with plywood. Ideal for working with materials that are 3/4 to 2-3/4 inches thick, the blade can also handle thinner or thicker materials, and it can be used to cut chipboard or laminates. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.094 kerf.In addition to offering faster cuts through tough materials, its large tooth design allows the blade to be safely sharpened more times, prolonging the life of the blade and saving you money. Plus the large gullets between these teeth ensure easy chip removal.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features an anti-vibration design that reduces chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis thin-kerf rip saw blade's 24 teeth are finished with tips made from an application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""ripping blend"" that offers improved density, hardness, corrosion resistance, and heat resistance.Ideal for the demands of ripping large quantities of thick, hard wood, this carbide blend includes extra cobalt for increased impact resistance. Plus, it delivers increased sharpness and edge retention, which means the blade will hold up longer--saving you money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

41848,Tools & Home Improvement,Factory-Reconditioned DEWALT DW682KR 6.5 Amp Plate Joiner,"One of the first companies to design plate joiners, DeWalt  makes one powerful slot-cutting tool. Some people argue that joiners  are joiners, and while it's true that a slot is a slot, how you cut it  makes a heck of a lot of difference. What impresses us about DeWalt's  plate joiner is the stout, dual rack-and-pinion fence. Operating with  striking smoothness, the fence locks tightly in place and ensures that  the joiner's blade and fence are always parallel--which means accurate  joints every time. The DeWalt is also the only plate joiner on the  market with a fully adjustable tilt fence: the face plate tilts 0 to 90  degrees, so you can join work at whatever angle the job requires  (22-1/2 degrees, say, if you're working in octagons). Cabinetmakers  will appreciate the convenience of being able to make flush cuts at 0  degrees without having to remove the fence. The 6-1/2 amp motor spins  the tool's carbide blade at 10,000 rpm, making remarkably quick, clean  cuts. We found the gauges easy to read and easy to set, a big plus  (there's nothing worse than wrestling with or squinting at a tool every  time you make adjustments). DeWalt's joiner also has preset stops for  all common biscuit sizes and there's a handy vacuum adapter that allows  you to hook up suction to keep dust in the shop to a minimum--always a  good idea.--Jon Groebner"

Fender Washers are great for holding sheets of metal parallel, and they are frequently used for attaching signs to posts and walls.Stainless steels are used for their corrosion resistance, high-temperature strength, scaling resistance, and low-temperature toughness.&#xA0; These properties account for their extremely wide use in practically every industry.  Austenitic Stainless Steels are alloys of iron and carbon that contain between 16% and 30% Chromium, a maximum of 0.15% carbon, along with Nickel (or Manganese), and other alloying elements.&#xA0; The chromium, which helps develop a passive surface oxide film, provides corrosion resistance in stainless steels.&#xA0;&#xA0; Austenitic Stainless Steels are designated by a 3 digit SAE Stainless Steel Grade beginning with the number 3 (e.g. 304, 316).&#xA0; Another common naming convention for Austenitic Stainless Steels are 18/8, 18/10, 18/0, etc. where the 18 refers to the % of Chromium and 8 to the % of Nickel contained in the material."

The nailer's deflector conveniently directs exhaust away from the user. We were impressed with how solid this Bostitch unit feels--it definitely has the burliness of an industrial-strength tool.

42533,Tools & Home Improvement,Makita 9523NBH 4-Inch Angle Grinder,"The first thing we noticed about this grinder is just how little it is, both in dimensions and weight. But switch it on, and it does the work of the big guys. The barrel of the tool is small, so it fits beautifully in your hand, and the auxiliary handle lends great control and comfort, installed either on the right or the left. Right on top of the motor housing is the power switch; we like it there for convenience as well as safety. Despite its small size, this grinder's definitely not lacking in power, with a max no-load rpm of 11,000, and the price makes it a great choice for both the professional and the home do-it-yourselfer or hobbyist. It's an unusual size: It's half an inch smaller than the standard small grinders we're used to seeing (though it offers the same max rpm), but it doesn't really make a difference in maneuverability or working in tight spaces. Makita always goes the extra mile in quality, and here, they've sealed the motor and bearings so contaminants don't shorten the tool's life. Wheel changes are easy and fast, and vibration is surprisingly low for its rpm.--Kris Jensen-Van Heste"

Hex Nuts have flat tops with chamfered corners; bottoms may be flat or chamfered.  Hex drive systems are driven with a wrench.Stainless steels are used for their corrosion resistance, high-temperature strength, scaling resistance, and low-temperature toughness.&#xA0; These properties account for their extremely wide use in practically every industry.  Austenitic Stainless Steels are alloys of iron and carbon that contain between 16% and 30% Chromium, a maximum of 0.15% carbon, along with Nickel (or Manganese), and other alloying elements.&#xA0; The chromium, which helps develop a passive surface oxide film, provides corrosion resistance in stainless steels.&#xA0;&#xA0; Austenitic Stainless Steels are designated by a 3 digit SAE Stainless Steel Grade beginning with the number 3 (e.g. 304, 316).&#xA0; Another common naming convention for Austenitic Stainless Steels are 18/8, 18/10, 18/0, etc. where the 18 refers to the % of Chromium and 8 to the % of Nickel contained in the material.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Coarse threads are better when working with brittle materials; they are sturdier and are easier to thread and unthread compared to fine.

43126,Tools & Home Improvement,JET JWL-1236 / 708352G 12-Inch Variable Speed Wood Lathe with Stand,"To woodworkers who know the reputation of Jet products, the merit of this 12-inch variable-speed lathe should come as no surprise. Start with the guts of any tool, the motor. Prewired for 115 volts and fully encased in a metal housing for longer life, its 3/4-horses turn material at 500 to 3,000 rpm, depending on which of the six speeds you select. The cast-iron lathe bed, headstock, and tailstock provide superior vibration dampening and durability, while the heavy-gauge steel components and stand give rigid support. Pivoting 90 degrees for outboard turning of up to 16-1/2 inches on larger projects, the MT-2 headstock protects a Reeves drive pulley system with which we made quick and easy speed changes. Down on the other end, the hollow tailstock allows for longer hole bores and houses a live center, a luxury standard on all Jet lathes not found in much of the competition.You'll love the versatility that comes with 34-1/2 inches between working centers and a 12-inch swing capability over the bed (8-3/4 inches over the tool-rest base). All adjustments, whether extending the ram its full 2-1/4 inches or sliding the 12-inch tool rest, move fluidly and clamp down tight with little effort. Designed for use over the long haul, this tool has all the qualities professional woodworkers demand.--Justin Paul"

43144,Tools & Home Improvement,DEWALT DW430 3-Inch x 21-Inch Heavy Duty Belt Sander,"DeWalt's 3-by-21-inch belt sander is a popular choice with do-it-yourselfers and many professionals, as well. It has a 5.2 amp motor with electronic speed control that keeps the belt speed constant under load. The variable-speed dial is easy to use and recessed well enough to prevent unintended adjustments while working; however, it's located near the rear of the handle, making on-the-fly changes a little tricky. DeWalt mounted the dust bag on the front of the sander, and while this allows the tool to be used in tight spaces, we found that the arrangement forced us to work directly above the sander if we wanted to maintain visibility. As the tool heats and cools, expanding and contracting, the self-tensioning system adjusts the belt to prevent slippage. We found it to track well from one operation to the next without requiring much adjustment. This is a great sander for do-it-yourselfers and most professionals, but it's not quite as burly as the biggest 3-by-21-inch belt sanders on the market, so people who intend to use a belt sander for the most strenuous tool testing jobs may want to consider a model with a bigger motor.--Brian Trinen"

A roller guide provides constant blade  stability in tight corners, and helps make alignment easy during blade  changes. The shoe bevels 45 degrees in either direction, and although  it does require a hex wrench for adjustments, the wrench stores handily  in a clip in the shoe. We like the lockable trigger on this jig saw,  too. It's large enough that you can pull it with two or three fingers,  which really reduces hand fatigue. We also appreciated the finger guard  that extends all the way down to the shoe on the front of the saw--a  nice safety feature. The saw comes with the hex key for shoe  adjustments, an antisplintering device, two T-shank blades, and a tough  carrying case.--Brian Trinen"

Stacked up next to the 7-1/4-inch saws, some of which weigh twice as much as this one, it sacrifices nothing in power or performance, but it&#x92;s so much easier to use that the bigger boys in your toolbox would be gathering some dust.It&#x92;s an amazingly light 6-1/2 pounds, and quite honestly, it feels like a toy when you first pick it up. But don&#x92;t be fooled by its petite dimensions. It plows across a 2-by-8 like nobody&#x92;s business, and if you&#x92;re used to a bigger, heavier circular saw, you can&#x92;t help but be delighted by how beautifully it handles. Taking it through a &#xBE;-inch sheet is a joyride.The left-side blade is perfect for right-handers, offering a nice clear sightline,  and all the adjustments are convenient and easy to use. The bevel lever is up front, and the action is smooth and easy to set precisely. Depth of cut adjusts from the back, and that, too, is done easily.If there are any caveats, we think it would be only that your capacity is slightly less with this little Skil as opposed to a bigger model, in that you can&#x92;t cut a 45-degree bevel on 2-by stock with this, and you&#x92;re at your max depth of cut at 90 degrees on a 2-by.For everything else, this is an absolute beauty of a saw that will never tax your back, your shoulder or your arm. Contractors who find themselves climbing ladders or working on scaffolds will especially love this saw, as well as homeowners who don&#x92;t feel confident taking on a beefy saw but still want to get the job done. --Kris Jensen-Van HesteWhat&#x92;s in the BoxSaw, blade wrench, combination blade"

For professional tasks that mock portable planers' capabilities, Jet's 15-inch enclosed-stand model gives you smooth surfaces as long as you keep it fed. Powered by a completely enclosed, 3-horsepower induction motor, it efficiently converts 230 volts into 13,500 cuts per minute at 4,500 rpm. The positive gear drive system adjusts depth quickly, and, with its smooth-cranking hand wheel, you can slice up to 1/8 of an inch off boards as large as 15 inches wide and 6 inches thick. Infeed and outfeed tables use three industrial steel rollers each to ensure smooth transfer from the planer's nonslip serrated intake all the way through the knives. You'll appreciate features like the smaller return rollers on top for handling large planks and the magnetic safety switch that prevents the machine from automatically turning on after power outages. Set on four heavy-duty, cam-lock casters, it easily rolls into position and stays where you place it. Go on and take the offer to gut those houses this year.--Justin Paul"
