It's way more expensive than the so-called ""pure olive oil"" but it's well worth the extra cost due to its absolutely amazing therapeutic value. You should also know that most of the essential oils & herbal extracts used byBadgerare organic or otherwise ecologically produced. The olive oil that we are using now comes to us directly from an organic grower's cooperative in the Andalusian Region of Spain. I've worked in these olive groves and followed the olives from tree through to completed product. We've got a personal connection with people we know and care about, and a guaranteed quality source.

5020,All Beauty,Light Mountain Natural Hair Color And Conditioner Light Brown - 4 Fl Oz,"Light Mountain Natural Hair Color and Conditioner Light BrownDescription:100% Premium HennaHenna coats each hair shaft with a natural, semi-permanent protein called hennatannic acid. Heat causes the hennatannic acid to cling to the proteins found in the hair (or nails and skin, if desired). Because henna coats and seals the hair shaft, it helps protect the hair from damaging effects of sun, salt, chlorine, wind and pollution in the environment. It can help miminize split ends and acts as hair insurance if you spend a lot of time in the sun, surf or wind. In addition to protecting the hair shaft, henna will tighten the hair cuticle and create a more solid surface which reflects light; the result is gleaming, lustrous hair.Rather than producing dramatic color changes, henna enhances and deepens existing color. The darker your natural color, the less drastic the change will be inyour natural color. Because the color from henna is transparent or seethrough, henna cannot lighten dark hair; it will, however, add highlights to dark hair and can darken the color of lighter hair.Free Of PPD, ammonia, peroxides, chemicals and contaminants.

For easy application warm Shea butter onto palms until it is completely melted and smooth on. Shea Butter absorbs quickly, penetrates deeply and coats the skin with a fine film; thereby diminishing water loss and leaving the skin softened and protected. The Amazing Properties of Shea Butter Shea butter is the best natural product to protect, heal and improve skin. It is prized because it contains a real cocktail of elements good for the skin. Among these, is first a very high content of Essential Fatty Acids, more than in all other vegetable butter. These fatty acids are oleic, stearic, linoleic and palmitic acid. They play a very important moisturizing, softening, and anti-inflammatory role, and help renew the cutaneous cells. Shea butter also contains vitamins A, D, E, and K that have a recognized effect against skin aging. It is also rich in phytosterols with protecting and regenerating virtues. The manufacturing process has a great influence on the properties and efficiency of Shea butter. If it is refined or processed, it loses its vitamins and part of its efficiency.

6859,All Beauty,Mango Butter White Raw 2 Lbs,"Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter is a fat obtained from the seeds of Mangifera indica tree or commonly known as a mango tree. Fruit of this tree is thought to have been cultivated for 4000 years or more. Mango is grown in nearly all the tropical areas of the world and indigenous people have been reaping the hair and skin care benefits of this magnificent fruit for many centuries. They believe that mango butter has healing and regenerative abilities. 
Mango Butter may be used to assist in skin/hair moisturization after exposure to harsh elements of the Mother Nature like sun, wind and cold. Give your skin a care it deserves with this hard working fruit known for its unique softening and moisturizing abilities. Enriched with vitamins (like A, E, &C;), multiple minerals and strong antioxidants, mango butter works hard to keep your skin, hair and scalp well nourished. Talk about a multi-faceted fruit!
Extracted from the seeds ""butter"" is carefully refined and deodorized via mild and natural processes to obtain a product which meets the stringent requirements for cosmetic applications. Mango Butter con-tains a high content of C18:0 and C18:1 fatty acids. It is solid at room temperatures, but liquefies on contact with skin and applies easily and evenly. Mango butter has similar benefits as cocoa and shea butters; however it contains higher levels of essential fatty acids making it a more intensive moisturizer.
This butter is used as a base ingredient in body care formulas, skin care products and soaps. Mango butter contains high level of unsaponifiables (components of fat/oil that do not turn into soap when combined with lye); thus, some addition of this butter to soaps will combat drying effects of bar soaps or cleansers. The formulator must be careful not to add too much, as an excess of unsaponifiables can result in a soft, poor quality soap bar."

Total Block Clear SPF 65,Cotz SPF 58,Lipcotz SPF 45, andTotal Block Tinted SPF 60, all combine multiple particle sizes of micronized titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and iron oxide to form a complete barrier from the light spectrum, including UVA/UVB.The Total Block Clear SPF 65, as well as the other Fallene products, are specially designed for photo-sensitive individuals, but are perfect for anyone concerned about maintaining healthy skin and promoting the integrity of their immune system.The Dangers of UVB WavelengthsSPF rating does not adequately measure protection from all the damaging radiation effects of light. SPF is only a determination of protection from one specific wavelength of ultraviolet radiation, the UVB (290nm - 320nm). Unfortunately, there is no currently approved standard to rate the quality of a sunscreen's UVA protective capabilities. UVA (320nm - 400nm) is the deeper penetrating wavelength that is more often associated with skin changes, such as wrinkling, pigmentation, and long term damage. The SPF rating system does not accurately or completely define a sunscreen's protective capabilities from harmful ultraviolet radiation, except the UVB wavelength.UVB creates a red, painful irritation first experienced during early sun exposure, but UVB is not the only ultraviolet wavelength damaging to the skin. In fact, UVB has only a minimal effect upon the deeper depth of skin. UVB and UVA radiation are both recognized as causing skin cancer, and SPF 30 protection is just not enough.Direct Physical Photoblockers BenefitsMost of the physical photoblockers are naturally occurring metal compounds (iron, chromium, zinc, titanium, etc), although some, such as bismuth, are man-made. In addition to their photo-protective attributes, these substances also assist in preventing windburns and skin damage from wind-driven micro-particles, such as dirt and grime. These physical blockers also offer a substantial defense against infrared rays in two ways.Winter, spring, summer or fall -- no matter what the season, Lipcotz SPF 45 protects your skin from harmful rays.Minimize wrinkling, skin-damage, and photo-aging with Fallene sun-protection products.First, particles that are large enough to be seen, i.e. the reflect visible light, will also reflect and refract infrared waves that are the most harmful to the skin (760nm - 1,800nm). Second, regardless of particle size, these metal-based materials act as a ""heat sink"" and thereby reduce the heat effect on the skin.Titanium Dioxide: Absorbs Light and Protects SkinThis white-pigment powder is widely used in cosmetics. Products containing large-particle titanium have a greater opacity, which means they have greater lightening or whitening qualities. Opaque titanium dioxide is highly reflective and strongly scatters all UV and visible rays. It also reflects much of the skin-damaging infrared waves, keeping skin cooler and reducing ""heat"" damage that causes unwanted photo-aging.To photo-stabilize titanium dioxide it must be micro-coated with a protectant, such as silicone or aluminum oxide. Since titanium dioxide spreads poorly on the skin, another way to inhibit its breakdown is to incorporate titanium dioxide with other blockers. To achieve cosmetic elegance and usefulness, microcoating the titanium dioxide assures a good, even application to the skin. A downside of large-particle titanium dioxide products is that they produce a white, opaque appearance on the skin when applied. However, submicronizing the titanium dioxide powder, as Fallene does, creates small particles that absorb visible light and protect the skin, but they're still invisible on the skin, so you're not covered in embarrassing white salve.Transparent (sub-micronized) titanium dioxide works by absorbing, reflecting and scattering UVB and some UVA rays. However, protection against UV, visible and infrared is significantly limited when submicronized titanium dioxide is the primary protectant.Zinc Oxide: Extends Photo-ProtectionZinc Oxide has been known and used topically for centuries as a skin protectant and wound-healing adjuvant and is also recognized as a mild antimicrobial agent. More than 50 years ago, zinc oxide was indicated as a block for ultraviolet light (UVB/UVA). It also reflects infrared from the skin, as does titanium dioxide. However, its ability to protect in the long UVA range (300nn - 400nm) is much higher than titanium dioxide. Zinc oxide absorbs, rather than scatters, most UVA, while titanium dioxide primarily scatters these wavelengths. Thus, formulated in combination with titanium dioxide, ultra-fine zinc oxide ""closes the window"" in the UVA range. Zinc oxide works to both complement titanium dioxide's protection and extend photo-protection to the skin where titanium dioxide is insufficient. The optimal particle size range for ultraviolet blocking zinc oxide (without blocking visible wavelengths) is approximately 80 to 150 nanometers (1,000 nanometers = 1 micron).Iron Oxides: Adds Color and Complements Primary UV Blocking AgentsIron oxide is used in a wide array of cosmetics to provide cover-up color. Cosmetic iron oxides are manufactured to a high purity, desired color and particle size.Iron oxide pigments for cosmetic use are micronized powders. They are available in a number of shades and tones of red, yellow, black and brown. These cosmetic pigments, if incorporated at adequate concentration and properly dispersed, not only add color, but they also provide significant skin protection from multiple wavelengths of light.Ultra-submicronized iron oxides protect against visible light waves, but also add a little color to the finished product. This allows for the addition of higher levels of infrared protecting iron oxides, while retaining the cosmetic elegance and shade of the final preparation. Submicronized iron oxides block ultraviolet rays, which is a great complement to the primary UV blocking agents.What's in the BoxFallene Total Block Clear SPF 65 sunscreen (2.0 fluid ounces)."

To meet their high standards, Shikai formulate and produce each item with extreme care at their facilities in California. What is Colloidal Oatmeal? COLLOIDAL OATMEAL is simply oats which have been ground to a fine powder and then suspended in water. The powdered oats absorb water, turning it slightly milky and thick. When added to a bath, the hydrated granules help moisturize, soothe and relieve minor skin irritations. The real benefits come from its ability to bind to the skin. And because of its affinity for water, it acts as a moisturizer by attracting and holding moisture on the skin&#39;s surface. In addition, protein components anchor moisturizers for long-lasting effect. The result is softer, more elastic skin. This binding action also creates a barrier which protects the skin from harmful substances. In addition, colloidal oatmeal acts as a soothing agent which helps reduce redness and itching. Minor skin irritations caused by poison oak, insect bites, sunburn and excessively dry skin may all be temporarily relieved by colloidal oatmeal baths."

Importance of Dry Skin Brushing:

DRY SKIN BRUSHING

It is well known that the skin is the largest organ in the body, and is responsible for one-fourth of the body's detoxification each day, also making it, one of the most important elimination organs! The skin is also known as the ""3rd"" kidneys and the lungs are known as the ""2nd"" kidneys. Toxicity can gather beneath the skin's surface from such common influences such as improper pH levels in body soaps, skin creams and anti-perspirants, plus synthetic fibers worn next to the skin with any of them contributing to a variety of skin problems and conditions.
When you do skin brushing, you help your lymph system to clean itself of the toxins, that collect in the lymph glands. You use a simple technique to improve the surface circulation on the skin and keep the pores of the skin open, encouraging your body's discharge of metabolic wastes, and resulting in an improved ability to combat bacteria, plus helping your skin to look and feel healthier and more resilient! Skin brushing is a perfect treatment for taking charge of your body and health."

Sal Suds is not soap-based and is formulated especially for all-purpose hard-surface cleaning. Perfect for general household cleaning: dishes floors laundry etc. Equally effective in hard or soft water rinsing freely hot or cold. Concentrated and self-preserving: no hidden preservatives or ingredients. No synthetic dyes or fragrances: all ingredients fully disclosed and described. Biodegrades rapidly after doing its job. Pure high-quality fir and spruce essential oils: no cheap harsh pine stump oil. No animal testing: Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics certified.Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS): This surfactant cuts grease and dirt, generates copious suds, and biodegrades quickly and completely. SLS is made by combining a sulfate group with lauryl alcohol from coconut oil, then attaching sodium. If improperly formulated, SLS can irritate skin, but our superb formula uses coco-betaine and lauryl glucoside to counter this. Coco-Betaine: Mild and easily biodegradable, coco-betaine is formed by combining coconut fatty acids with betaine (a nature-identical synthetic so-named because it was first discovered in sugar beets). This foam-boosting cleansing agent buffers irritation caused by SLS. Lauryl Glucoside: This powerful grease-cutting surfactant is especially mild and quickly biodegradable, and is made by combining glucose from corn with fatty alcohols from coconut and palm kernel oils. Lauryl glucoside not only works with SLS to cut dirt and oily soils with exceptional ease, but also combines with coco-betaine to give Sal Suds smooth mildness. Fir Needle Oil & Spruce Oil: Pure essential oils from fir and spruce give Sal Suds its wonderful aroma. Most other cleansers use synthetic fragrances or cheap harsh pine stump oil."

Total Block Tinted SPF 60,Cotz SPF 58,Lipcotz SPF 45, andTotal Block Clear SPF 65, all combine multiple particle sizes of micronized titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and iron oxide to form a complete barrier from the light spectrum, including UVA/UVB.The Total Block Tinted SPF 60, as well as the other Fallene products, are specially designed for photo-sensitive individuals, but are perfect for anyone concerned about maintaining healthy skin and promoting the integrity of their immune system.The Dangers of UVB WavelengthsSPF rating does not adequately measure protection from all the damaging radiation effects of light. SPF is only a determination of protection from one specific wavelength of ultraviolet radiation, the UVB (290nm - 320nm). Unfortunately, there is no currently approved standard to rate the quality of a sunscreen's UVA protective capabilities. UVA (320nm - 400nm) is the deeper penetrating wavelength that is more often associated with skin changes, such as wrinkling, pigmentation, and long term damage. The SPF rating system does not accurately or completely define a sunscreen's protective capabilities from harmful ultraviolet radiation, except the UVB wavelength.UVB creates a red, painful irritation first experienced during early sun exposure, but UVB is not the only ultraviolet wavelength damaging to the skin. In fact, UVB has only a minimal effect upon the deeper depth of skin. UVB and UVA radiation are both recognized as causing skin cancer, and SPF 30 protection is just not enough.Direct Physical Photoblockers BenefitsMost of the physical photoblockers are naturally occurring metal compounds (iron, chromium, zinc, titanium, etc), although some, such as bismuth, are man-made. In addition to their photo-protective attributes, these substances also assist in preventing windburns and skin damage from wind-driven micro-particles, such as dirt and grime. These physical blockers also offer a substantial defense against infrared rays in two ways.Winter, spring, summer or fall -- no matter what the season, Lipcotz SPF 45 protects your skin from harmful rays.Minimize wrinkling, skin-damage, and photo-aging with Fallene sun-protection products.First, particles that are large enough to be seen, i.e. the reflect visible light, will also reflect and refract infrared waves that are the most harmful to the skin (760nm - 1,800nm). Second, regardless of particle size, these metal-based materials act as a ""heat sink"" and thereby reduce the heat effect on the skin.Titanium Dioxide: Absorbs Light and Protects SkinThis white-pigment powder is widely used in cosmetics. Products containing large-particle titanium have a greater opacity, which means they have greater lightening or whitening qualities. Opaque titanium dioxide is highly reflective and strongly scatters all UV and visible rays. It also reflects much of the skin-damaging infrared waves, keeping skin cooler and reducing ""heat"" damage that causes unwanted photo-aging.To photo-stabilize titanium dioxide it must be micro-coated with a protectant, such as silicone or aluminum oxide. Since titanium dioxide spreads poorly on the skin, another way to inhibit its breakdown is to incorporate titanium dioxide with other blockers. To achieve cosmetic elegance and usefulness, microcoating the titanium dioxide assures a good, even application to the skin. A downside of large-particle titanium dioxide products is that they produce a white, opaque appearance on the skin when applied. However, submicronizing the titanium dioxide powder, as Fallene does, creates small particles that absorb visible light and protect the skin, but they're still invisible on the skin, so you're not covered in embarrassing white salve.Transparent (sub-micronized) titanium dioxide works by absorbing, reflecting and scattering UVB and some UVA rays. However, protection against UV, visible and infrared is significantly limited when submicronized titanium dioxide is the primary protectant.Zinc Oxide: Extends Photo-ProtectionZinc Oxide has been known and used topically for centuries as a skin protectant and wound-healing adjuvant and is also recognized as a mild antimicrobial agent. More than 50 years ago, zinc oxide was indicated as a block for ultraviolet light (UVB/UVA). It also reflects infrared from the skin, as does titanium dioxide. However, its ability to protect in the long UVA range (300nn - 400nm) is much higher than titanium dioxide. Zinc oxide absorbs, rather than scatters, most UVA, while titanium dioxide primarily scatters these wavelengths. Thus, formulated in combination with titanium dioxide, ultra-fine zinc oxide ""closes the window"" in the UVA range. Zinc oxide works to both complement titanium dioxide's protection and extend photo-protection to the skin where titanium dioxide is insufficient. The optimal particle size range for ultraviolet blocking zinc oxide (without blocking visible wavelengths) is approximately 80 to 150 nanometers (1,000 nanometers = 1 micron).Iron Oxides: Adds Color and Complements Primary UV Blocking AgentsIron oxide is used in a wide array of cosmetics to provide cover-up color. Cosmetic iron oxides are manufactured to a high purity, desired color and particle size.Iron oxide pigments for cosmetic use are micronized powders. They are available in a number of shades and tones of red, yellow, black and brown. These cosmetic pigments, if incorporated at adequate concentration and properly dispersed, not only add color, but they also provide significant skin protection from multiple wavelengths of light.Ultra-submicronized iron oxides protect against visible light waves, but also add a little color to the finished product. This allows for the addition of higher levels of infrared protecting iron oxides, while retaining the cosmetic elegance and shade of the final preparation. Submicronized iron oxides block ultraviolet rays, which is a great complement to the primary UV blocking agents.What's in the BoxFallene Total Block Tinted SPF 60 sunscreen (2.0 fluid ounces)."

To get the most out of ROGAINE Extra Strength Solution, it's important to apply it directly to your scalp--twice a day, every day.What Causes Hair Loss in Men?Although there are several causes of hair loss, male-pattern baldness (also referred to as androgenetic alopecia or hereditary hair loss) accounts for about 95&#37; of hair loss in men. It is usually triggered by a combination of hormonal activity and heredity, which together cause the hair follicles in your scalp to shrink.Over time, the progressive shrinking of certain scalp follicles leads to a shortening of the hair's growing cycle. Hair becomes thinner and shorter, until there is no growth at all. The active ingredient in ROGAINE--minoxidil--reinvigorates shrunken hair follicles, which increases their size and helps regrow thicker looking hair over time.A Pioneer in Hair RegrowthLike many great discoveries, the power of minoxidil to regrow hair came about by chance. In the 1980s, scientists discovered that minoxidil, being studied for other indications, actually showed signs of regrowing hair.ROGAINE applied this discovery to produce the first topical brand approved by the FDA to regrow hair. Minoxidil is the only over-the-counter ingredient FDA approved to regrow hair. Since the discovery, ROGAINE has empowered millions of people to take control of their hair loss with a series of breakthroughs.About ROGAINE: A History of Results and InnovationROGAINE is the first topical brand approved by the FDA to regrow hair--in both men and women. With more than 20 years of results and over 20,000 people in clinical trials, ROGAINE is the #1 dermatologist-recommended brand for hair regrowth.

26162,All Beauty,Pearl Powder,"Pearl is a very special herbal substance used since ancient times. Powdered Pearl is used as a Shen tonic to stabilize the emotions, allay fright, ease frustration and anger, brighten the eyes and help regenerate tissue. Pearl is also used as a major beauty tonic, because it is believed that oral consumption of Pearl powder results in lustrous, pure, beautiful skin. Pearl powder is also used topically in skin creams to purify the skin.. Pearls have a tremendous reputation in China as both a beauty tonic and as a Shen tonic. Recent Chinese medical texts credit pearl with the ability to relieve uneasiness of the heart and mind, to benefit reproduction, to relieve ""wandering arthritis,"" to relieve internal fever, to clear sputum, to remove visual obstacles and improve eyesight, to promote muscle development and to invigorate blood circulation. As a beauty tonic, pearl is hard to beat. The components in pearl powder help heal blemishes and maintain the health of the skin by participating in the metabolic activities of the skin. Pearl promotes the regeneration of new cells and makes the skin smooth, fine, elastic and naturally beautiful. High quality pearl powder can promote the activities of the important natural antioxidant enzyme, SOD, and can help prevent the development of melanin, which causes freckles and dark patches on the skin. It can help prevent the skin from becoming old looking, wrinkled and sagging. This is partly due to its stimulation of SOD activity and partly due to other capacities and nutrients. Consistent use of pearl powder can eliminate blemishes such as colored spots and even pimples and boils. Constant use can help assure that the skin will age much more slowly and that it will not be easily harmed by either time or the elements. Pearl is one of the great secrets of the most beautiful women of the Orient. The Dowager Empress Xi consumed pearl every day to maintain her stunning beauty."

For optimum styling, this hair dryer system uses ionic technology to reduce drying time and make hair shinier, more manageable, and static-free.Three different attachment barrels provide numerous styling opportunities. The straight barrel is designed to work with styling sprays and delivers maximum air velocity through the long tube, while reducing both noise and drying time. The aerated barrel is better for drying medium to long hair, as the circular ribs separate strands of hair and gently dry them from root to tip.

All three barrels securely fasten to the end of the dryer using Wahl&#x92;s Positive Lock system.Other features of this hairdryer include three heat and three speed settings; a cool-shot button for setting styles with cold air; and a removable air filter for easy cleaning.

Vitamin C&#x92;s major role is to make collagen, a protein substance that holds connective tissues together in the skin, bone, teeth, and other areas. Vitamin C is also critical for the proper function of our immune system, for manufacturing certain nerve-transmitting substances and hormones, and for the absorption and utilization of other nutrients, such as vitamin E and iron. Vitamin C is also a very important and powerful antioxidant that works in the aqueous (water) environments of the body, such as the lungs and lens of the eye. Though its primary antioxidant partners are vitamin E and the carotenes (beta-carotene), it also works with the antioxidant enzymes.

Dr. Dennis Sepp, an organic and medicinal chemist, began exploring the unique properties of certain plants and their benefits for hair and skin. His first studies were done with shikakai, a plant which grows in India and is well known for it's ability to clean hair, leave it silky, soft and shiny, and not dry the hair or scalp. The result was a shampoo which was an immediate hit with friends, family, and local health food stores. Thus, in 1970, the original ShiKai Shampoo was created and a new company formed. Today ShiKai has more than 50 products which are made, start to finish, at the ShiKai facilities in Santa Rosa. Dr. Sepp continues to oversee the formulation and manufacture of all items."

41690,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Frontier Natural Products - German Chamomile Flowers Whole Organic - 1 lb.,"Frontier Natural Products - Chamomile Flower Whole Certified Organic - 1 lb. (16 oz. / 453 g) Frontier Natural Products Certified Organic Chamomile Flower contains non-irradiated chamomile flowers that are freshness dated. To ensure fresh flavor that's always pure and natural, Frontier's spices are quality tested and freshness dated. Chamomile is sometimes called ""the children's tea"" because it's so gentle, because the taste is tolerated by most children (a bit of honey in the tea doesn't hurt), and because its attributes mesh nicely with many of the woes of childhood. It makes a nice tea for a fussy child (or adult), and it helps to soothe the tummy and to reduce restlessness at bedtime. Botanical Family: Asteraceae Botanical name: Matricaria recutita L. Common name: German chamomile Constituents of Note: The essential oil, present at 0.3 to 1.9%, is the most important constituent in chamomile and is valued in aromatherapy oil. Key constituents of the oil include chamazulene, alpha-bisabolol, bisabolol oxides A and B and bisabolene. The chamazulene develops during steam distillation, giving the essential oil its characteristic blue color, but it is not present in flowers. German chamomile flowers also contain flavonoids (apigenin, apigetrin, querciten), coumarins, proazulenes, triterpene alcohols, sterols, sesquiterpenes, plant acids and tannins. Did you know? In the children's story Peter Rabbit, Peter's mother gives him chamomile tea (after a proper scolding) before sending him to bed after his return from Mr. McGregor's farm. No doubt the chamomile tea helped to soothe both Peter's nerves (after his harrowing escape) and his tummy (after feasting on the farmer's produce). Flavorful, comforting, gentle, traditional chamomile tea is made with German chamomile flowers. A versatile herb, chamomile is also an ingredient in shampoos and conditioners for light colored hair, in skin care creams and lotions, and in relaxing bath blends."

Condition. ROGAINE.You may have hereditary hair loss, but you don't need to live with it forever. Women's ROGAINE contains topical minoxidil, the only FDA-approved over-the-counter ingredient clinically proven to regrow hair. ROGAINE works by getting inside your scalp to revitalize follicles and stimulate hair regrowth. That's why ROGAINE is the #1 dermatologist-recommended product for hereditary hair loss in women. The sooner you start, the better your chances of regrowing your hair.The Hair Growth Process: What Causes Hair Loss?Did you know the average woman is born with about 100,000 hair follicles on her head--and she keeps them for the rest of her life? Most women lose between 50 and 100 hairs a day. If your hair is healthy, it will grow back on its own. But if you're one of the 30 million women in America who experience hereditary hair loss, you may be losing 150 hairs or more a day--hair that doesn't grow back as thick and healthy as it once was.You may notice more hair on your brush, in your sink, or in the shower drain. As your hair begins to look thinner, it may become a challenge to style. The good news is, with ROGAINE, you can take control of hair loss and start regrowing beautiful, healthy hair--especially if you begin treatment at the very first signs of hair loss.Use Styling Products with ROGAINE? Sure!Using ROGAINE doesn't mean giving up your favorite styling products. So spray away. Gel it up and/or mousse around. Just make sure your styling aids don't interfere with letting ROGAINE become absorbed into your scalp. Always remember to wait until ROGAINE dries before you use your styling aids, and be sure to apply styling aids to your hair--not to your scalp.Waiting for ROGAINE to dry shouldn't slow you down one bit. Many women multitask. They apply ROGAINE and then, while ROGAINE dries, they put on makeup, have breakfast, or answer e-mail before they style their hair.A Pioneer in Hair RegrowthLike many great discoveries, the power of minoxidil to regrow hair came about by chance. In the 1980s, scientists discovered that minoxidil, being studied for other indications, actually showed signs of regrowing hair.ROGAINE applied this discovery to produce the first topical brand approved by the FDA to regrow hair. Since then, ROGAINE has empowered millions of people to take control of their hair loss with a series of breakthroughs.About ROGAINE: A History of Results and InnovationROGAINE is the first topical brand approved by the FDA to regrow hair--in both women and men. With more than 20 years of results and over 20,000 people in clinical trials, ROGAINE is the #1 dermatologist-recommended brand for hair regrowth. ROGAINE helps reverse the progression of hereditary hair loss.What's in the BoxWomen's ROGAINE Unscented Topical Solution (2-Ounce Bottles, Pack of 3).Once the formula completely dries, you can continue to use gel, hair spray, or mousse to style your hair."

His first studies were done with shikakai, a plant which grows in India and is well known for it's ability to clean hair, leave it silky, soft and shiny, and not dry the hair or scalp. The result was a shampoo which was an immediate hit with friends, family, and local health food stores. Thus, in 1970, the original ShiKai Shampoo was created and a new company formed. Today ShiKai has more than 50 products which are made, start to finish, at the ShiKai facilities in Santa Rosa. Dr. Sepp continues to oversee the formulation and manufacture of all items."

The revoultionary all natural formula contains Hyaluronic Acid and Matrixyl 3000.

Hyaluronic Acid (HA), also known as, also known as hyaluronan or hyaluronate, is a mucopolysaccharide, a natural carbohydrate, present throughout the human body.

When not bound to other molecules, it binds to water giving it a stiff viscous quality similar to ""Jello"". Its consistency and tissue-friendliness allows it to be beneficial in skin-care products as an excellent moisturizer. Hyaluronic Acid is one of the most hydrophilic (water-loving) molecules in nature with numerous benefits for the human body it can be described as ""nature's moisturizer"".


Matrixyl 3000 acts as a miracle in solving wrinkle problem. It works because its two components, called Matrinkines, are wonderful for giving the skin a bit of bounce and lift. The two components are individually called palmitoyl oligopeptide and palmitoyl tetra peptide 7

How Matrilines work

Matrikines act by telling the genes and cells what to do. They signal when repairs are needed and help to get the ball rolling on those repairs. So, cells that are being controlled by matrikines tend t be much healthier. It is this property of Matrixyl 3000 that makes it a must have ingredient in Anti-wrinkle skin care.

 

Numerous studies point out that Matrixyl 3000 supports the cells and improves the production of skin-revitalizing collagen.
