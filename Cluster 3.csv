435,Baby Products,The Famous Composers Series (Lovely Baby Music presents),"Named ""2006 CD of the Year"" by Creative Child Magazine --Creative Child Magazine2007 Parents' Choice Award Winner -  Raimond Lap employs the timeless music of the masters (Bach, Beethoven and Mozart) while introducing the delightful vocalization of babies, their laughter and their uniquely distinctive and honest reactions-whether to the music itself or something else entirely, the mix in ingenious. Adding sound effects of water and birdcalls seems so perfectly appropriate for children from infants to three years. Certainly, sounds of water are calming for babies as they must be accustomed to hearing the sounds of water in the womb. Coupled with birdcalls, these two distinctive sounds seem to touch on the familiar and the resoundingly new sounds a baby will hear. Additionally, the use of synthesizer is completely suitable for children in this age bracket as their auditory sense is still developing and music manipulated in this way may provide a more delicate introduction to timbres. --Parents' Choice FoundationAward-winning Dutch composer, Raimond Lap, believes that listening to great classical music helps to stimulate babies brains and aids in their musical and intellectual development. This series features 10 musical compositions from each of three great composers: Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart. Each piece is flawlessly performed using one or more musical instruments as well as sounds from a baby, nature, birds, and toys. A treat for babies and parents. --School Library Journal - March, 2007"

Air enters and exits the bottle without mixing with the milk, greatly reducing gas, colic, and messy spit-ups, while also minimizing pressure on your baby's ear canals. The BPA- and Phthalate-free bottle comes in a variety of sizes so your baby can grow with the VentAire system.Easy Cleanup and Convenient, Pre-Calibrated BottlesFor added convenience, the VentAire bottles open at both ends for easy cleaning.

It is their most popular highchair, and understandably so given it's attractive, practical, and stylish design.Out of the box, you need only a screwdriver and the included hex wrench to construct the chair. It's a fairly quick process that once you complete, you won't need tools to adjust. Position the seat with safety belt and footrest to the height of your child, slide in the adjustable tray, and you are ready for feeding time.The chair is recommended for ages four months to adult. It might be hard to imagine an adult using the chair as pictured, but once you remove the feeding tray and footrest, you can easily see that it is useable and useful for all ages. The beauty of the chair is its all-wood construction and luster finish. It has the look of bent plywood (for all of you Eames fans) that goes well with a modern d&eacute;cor. But, well-crafted wood furniture is almost always timeless and accommodates many different decorating schemes. The euro-baby family highchair is sturdy, stylish, and functional. It will look great in your dining area and will have baby ready and willing for meal time. --Scott Teal"

Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that, it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60-year-old Gert began her role as ""Mother Boyle"" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally."

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective and price competitive--making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables with the most attributes.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

Car seats are not included in this set but if you have one already, and chances are you do, this makes for a handy way to go for a walk.--Charlie Williams"

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective and price competitive--making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

As your child grows, easily convert the seat to a backless booster, which can be used for children ages four to ten, between 40 and 100 pounds in weight, 40 and 57 inches in height.Also available in&nbsp;&nbsp;MoonstoneAbout GracoIn 1942, Russell Gray and Robert Cone formed Graco Metal Products, in Philadelphia, PA. For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's in the BoxGraco TurboBooster SafeSeat Youth Booster Car Seat, Step 3 (Red Line)."
6731,Baby,Combi Transition High Chair/Table And Chair Marina,"Someone had his thinking cap on when this high chair was designed. Plenty of baby furniture is built for only one short stage of development. But the Transition chair goes from standard high chair to toddler chair and table almost instantaneously. When baby has graduated out of the messy high chair days and is ready to move on to new, more advanced levels of mess, simply push one button to remove the seat from the high chair base, flip the base on its side, and voila! Baby&#x92;s high chair is now Big Kid&#x92;s very own table and chair, complete with pencil tray and book support, ready for years more of service. In high chair mode, the chair is lightweight and portable, with a removable, dishwasher-safe double tray with two bottle or cup holders. The seat reclines to three different positions, and has a removable, washable seat cushion. There is also a five-point harness for safety which, as any parent who has watched baby leaning waaay over the tray to see where those mashed peas went will tell you, is not overkill!--Emilie Coulter"

6825,Baby,"Joovy Caboose Stand-On Tandem, Blue Check","Toddlers can certainly be fickle&#x97;especially when it comes to traveling. One minute they want to be big kids and walk and next they want to be just like their baby brother or sister and ride in the stroller. Joovy&#x92;s Stand-On Tandem Stroller offers the perfect solution in a clever design: a front seat that accommodates an infant in a compatible car seat carrier or a baby from 6 months old until he reaches 45 pounds and a rear platform for an older child, starting at age 2-1/2 and weighing up to 45 pounds (or 40 inches), to jump on and catch a ride when he tires of walking. The platform even features a padded seat where the standing child can sit down and rest while Mom pushes the stroller.The Joovy Stand-On Tandem Stroller is a great advancement in stroller travel for parents of two children under the age of fiveFor the front seat, a universal car seat carrier attachment is included and, similar to Baby Trend&#x92;s Snap &#x91;n Go stroller, the front can be adjusted to accommodate most major brands. At 6 months or when babies can sit up on their own, they may use the seat. The seat offers two positions, one upright and one slightly reclined for babies who fall asleep in the stroller. The black and blue check seat is made of durable ripstop nylon and is padded all the way around, including the armrests. However, the back and base of the seat is pretty hard so this stroller may not be comfy for long stretches. A three-point harness straps baby in and is easy to unbuckle with one hand. Webbing holds the top of the straps flat against the seat back to reduce twisting of the straps. A two-position foot rest snaps into a vertical position for little babies with short legs and then folds down when a toddler&#x92;s legs get longer and are more comfortable hanging down.The stand-on platform area offers plenty of space for two little feet to ride in a forward-facing position. Two padded handles give toddlers a secure hold while riding and a belt-like harness clips behind the child to provide a little extra security in case he tries to lean back while cruising. This harness doesn&#x92;t provide a wealth of extra stability though and parents will need to watch that the child doesn&#x92;t try to step off the rolling stroller without warning. A rear-facing seat, cushioned with identical padding as the front seat, is also available for toddlers who get tired of being on their feet. When children are seated, the standing platform becomes a foot rest and a three-point harness contains them a bit better. The seat slides forward to provide access to a decently sized mesh storage basket. Because the seat does not lock into place, it could be prone to moving while a child is sitting in it.Made of lightweight aluminum, the chassis on this stroller is sturdy in construction but barebones and functional-looking in design. A few of the features do appear flimsy, such as the front footrest, which is made of very lightweight plastic, and the ratchet on the canopy. However, the inexpensive design choices do keep the price low and affordable for most families. Not that there aren&#x92;t any design perks on the Joovy Tandem: The front wheels rotate 360-degrees for supreme maneuverability through crowds or twisting paths. There is also a front wheel lock to hook wheels in a forward-facing position; for example, when your older child wants to push the baby in the stroller and you want to make sure he aims straight ahead. Another great feature is the ratcheting canopy, which can be pulled down to completely cover one of the two children or left in the central position to give each child adequate overhead shading.The handlebar for parents has soft, slip-resistant padding around the bar for comfortable pushing, but lacks the adult drink/accessory tray that is incorporated into the design of most strollers these days. The bar is on the high side so kids can duck under it to get to the ride-on platform and is not height adjustable. More petite moms might find it awkward to push a stroller that hits at chest level rather than at the midsection or waist.When the ride is over, closing up the Joovy Tandem couldn&#x92;t be easier. The two red levers on each side of the handlebar lift easily and the stroller folds forward to a pretty compact position for storage or car travel (although it&#x92;ll be easier to stash in a ""mom vehicle"" like an SUV or wagon than a more compact car). The levers lock when the stroller is open so there&#x92;s no chance of the stroller accidentally collapsing during motion. Even though the frame is lightweight, this stroller is still pretty cumbersome to heave into a car or lug into a closet, so parents shouldn&#x92;t plan on carrying it too far.All in all, the Joovy Stand-On Tandem Stroller is a great advancement in stroller travel for parents of two children under the age of five, offering plenty of cruising options for the older sibling. The only thing this stroller can&#x92;t do is prevent toddlers from wanting to push their sibling in the stroller&#x97;and they all want to do it. Moms, you&#x92;re on your own with that one.--Cristina Vaamonde"

6976,Baby,"Britax Parkway Booster Car Seat, Onyx","Britax International has been manufacturing innovative, industry-leading child products for over three decades. Their dedication to safety, comfort, and convenience is apparent in every aspect of this functional and fashionable booster seat. Parents will love being able to effortlessly secure their child in the car and the peace of mind that comes with Britax&#x92;s renowned attention to safety standards. Children will love that the Parkway is comfortable from day one, adjusts to stay that way, and has amenities just for them.Before we get into the features of the Parkway, it should be noted that booster seats are meant to be used with standard, factory-installed lap and shoulder belts in your vehicle. Booster seats do not use LATCH or any other tether system, but are secured by the child&#x92;s weight and a properly buckled seatbelt. The Parkway is meant to give occupants a ""boost"" so that the car&#x92;s seatbelt can sit safely across their torso.Safety first is a good rule of thumb, and one that Britax certainly heeds. The belt-positioning Parkway booster seat was designed for increased safety, incorporating deep torso and adjustable height head support. The multi-position headrest is simple to work with only one hand and allows the seat to grow with your child, up to 60"" tall. Your child is too tall for the Parkway once the tops of their ears are above the top of the fully raised headrest.The multi-position headrest can be easily adjusted with just one hand.The Parkway also features Britax-engineered True Side Impact Protection. It has been confirmed through rigorous side impact sled testing to better contain a child in dangerous, side-impact crashes. The reinforced headrest is lined with EPS foam to absorb energy, and its design cradles the child&#x92;s head to keep it away from protruding parts and minimize and cushion violent side to side movements. The Parkway meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213, a set of strict standards to which child restraint systems must adhere.With safety clearly taken care of, Britax moved on to comfort and convenience features. The Parkway&#x92;s seat shape correctly positions the lap belt over your child&#x92;s pelvis while the color-coded belt guides keeps the vehicle&#x92;s belt comfortably away from their neck. The plush fabric seat cover is removable and washable, and comes in a range of colors and patterns. Drink and snack trays are easily accessible. The reclining backrest allows your child to be in ultimate comfort on long trips or when sleeping. The base of the booster seat is contoured and slip-resistant, providing additional peace of mind. When empty, the Parkway weighs a mere 10 pounds, making it a cinch to move between vehicles when necessary."

All the appeal of the original, plus a remote. The music box is (easily) attached to the crib bars, and the mobile with swiveling arm ascends from the box to hang over the crib, out of baby&#x92;s reach. One button on the music box starts a 15-minute cycle of music by Mozart, Beethoven, or Bach; or individual composers&#x92; buttons can be pushed if baby has a yen for 15 minutes of Bach, say. Goofy zoo animals sporting polka dots and multi-colored feet (a la Dr. Seuss) are angled to baby&#x92;s line of vision&#x97;not the parent&#x92;s. The arms rotate as the music plays, causing beads to slide with a satisfying click on each turn. All this commotion can, of course, be initiated by the remote as well, which is a powerful feature for parents who know that one glimpse of mama or papa may be enough to get baby riled up again. Once baby is big and strong enough to grab the toys, it&#x92;s time to retire the mobile. But keep that music box around&#x97;baby will love the music forever, and will enjoy pushing the buttons herself one day! Requires two ""AAA"" batteries (not included).--Emilie Coulter"

7469,Baby,Sunshine Kids Radian65 Convertible Car Seat - Champagne,"Not all babies and toddlers fit the ""standard"" sizes for car seats and boosters. Some might be too tall for an infant seat but too light for a booster--and vice versa. The Sunshine Kids Radian 65 car seat aims to include those in-between children. With safety and performance at its core, Sunshine Kids designed an omnibus convertible that combines maximum protection, comfort, and ease of use. It starts with the steel alloy frame; complemented with expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam around the head, neck, and torso; and completed with comfort foam and plush padding. Install in a rear-facing position for infants five to 33 pounds via seatbelts or using the LATCH system (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children). Strap baby in with the padded five-point harness and attach the two-piece sternum clip. Comfort pads will help prevent chafing on the neck and shoulders. Convert to a forward-facing booster seat for toddlers and children up to 65 pounds. You can use the five-point harness up to the maximum weight, and the five shoulder strap heights grow with the child. Feel safer knowing that your child has the same impact protection well into their school age years. The Sunshine Kids Radian 65 quickly folds for a depth of seven inches. The steel frame is less bulky than the normal plastic, and the narrow bottom allows for multiple car seats in the back. Manufacturer recommended age is birth and up with a maximum weight of 65 pounds and maximum height of 49 inches. --Scott Teal"

The real innovation for this booster is its ability to fold compactly, and weighing less than 10 pounds, it is easy to tote and fit in the trunk. The six-position height adjust grows at the base, rather than the head, to ensure that the child is always fully enclosed. It's deeper and wider than other boosters for comfort, but the narrow bottom rails allow it to fit in sculpted bucket seats. The rotating handles and retractable cup holders are convenient, and overall the Compass B500 performed superbly.  --Scott Teal"

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective and price competitive --making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables with the best attributes.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

The non-descript beige polyester fabric blends into any d&#xE9;cor and is versatile enough to move the chair into a master bedroom or family room once it is no longer needed in the nursery. The cushions on this chair make it very comfortable for its price range--especially when you consider that the alternative to rocking a baby while seated is pacing around and doing deep knee bends in the wee hours of the night. While this glider only has one position (upright), its rocking motion is still sufficient for lulling baby to sleep and it glides silently with no disruptive squeaks. Plus, the ottoman lets Mom put her feet up even if she can&#x92;t recline. This glider and ottoman set requires light assembly.--Cristina Vaamonde"

13054,Baby,Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,"Colic. The word strikes fear in the heart of any parent. This mysterious ailment seems to have its roots in the belly of the baby, although no one has determined for sure what causes these uncontrollable bouts of crying in newborns. However, it is certain that a baby with gas is an unhappy baby, and anything that alleviates that pain can only be a good thing. Enter Dr. Brown&#x92;s Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set. For parents who bottle-feed, for whatever reason, these specialized bottles may make the difference between a howling, gassy baby and one who is content and well-fed. What&#x92;s the secret?Internal Vent Decreases Vacuum EffectA patented system enables babies to feed more comfortably because the built-in vent discourages ingestion of air bubbles. It also prevents the development of a vacuum, which helps reduce fluid in the ear. Ensuring that the milk in the bottle flows out through the nipple while the air is channeled through a tube to the other end also eliminates another unique problem of bottle-feeding: nipple collapse. The positive-pressure design mimics breastfeeding and can be used with breast milk or formula.In Plain English, PleaseThe bottle prevents air bubbles from getting into baby&#x92;s tummy.No Air Bubbles, No GasAnd no gas, no colic&#x85;at least that&#x92;s the principle. At a minimum, baby will be more comfortable while his digestive system develops.A Note to ParentsThe first time parents use the Natural Flow system, they will need to be very conscientious about readingand followingthe detailed instructions. No shortcuts, please! Washing the bottle parts carefully is always important, and resisting the urge to become cavalier about mixing formula, heating milk, or checking for tears or cracks is important to your baby&#x92;s health and safety. Time spent attending to these details is well spent.What&#x92;s in the Box?Dr. Brown&#x92;s newborn feeding set includes everything needed to get started on the wonderful, ever-changing world of sustaining an infant (except the actual milk, that is): Three 8-ounce standard baby bottles, two 4-ounce standard baby bottles, five Level-One silicone nipples, two extra Level-Two silicone nipples (faster-flowing for the older baby), five 2-piece patented internal vents, two storage/travel caps, three cleaning brushes, and instructions.--Emilie Coulter"

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective, price competitive--making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables with the most attributes.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

There is an included headrest for both the newborn and infant stages that provides additional support and comfort to baby.Toddlers can be bathed in the large end once sitting up on their own.Finally, in the toddler position, the sling can be moved to the wide end of the tub or removed altogether, giving baby more room and offering back support for sitting upright.Because bathing isn&#x92;t just about getting clean (it&#x92;s also supposed to be fun!), the Aquarium Bath Center has some other great features. Soft armrests along both sides of the tub keep mom and dad comfortable so they won&#x92;t have to rush through bath time.

The only problem is that even though she's practically climbing out of your arms, she can't crawl or walk yet. Ease your baby's need to explore the world with the Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker.Your baby is old enough to use this walker if she is able to sit without assistance; weighs less than 30 pounds; is less than 32 inches tall; and is not yet able to walk. If you baby fits these criteria, then keep on reading if you want your child to enjoy all the health and play benefits this walker has to offer.Whimsical characters surrounded by blinking lights and sounds will keep your baby entertained.View larger.The walker seat features machine-washable fabric for easy clean up.Special safety grips are designed to reduce sudden movement and prevent tipping.View larger.Designed with Safety in MindNot only does the Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker meet all JPMA and ASTM safety standards, but this fun and colorful walker is also specially designed with several extra safety measures that will ensure your baby's safety as he or she moves around your house. For starters, the Grip'n Go features special safety grips located on the bottom of the walker that are designed to reduce sudden movement and the risk of tipping should your baby roam to an uneven surface in your house. Another special feature includes the safety brakes on the walker's back wheels that will keep the walker stationary during those times when you need to answer the phone or turn your back momentarily. And finally, special gripping handles are built into the walker that are designed to make your baby feel more secure.Easy to Construct, Easy to Use, and Easy to MaintainConstructed from durable, molded plastic, the Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker is both lightweight -- essential, of course, for your baby to navigate easily -- and extremely easy to clean. The seat features machine-washable fabric for easy clean up, while the walker itself folds down in a few simple steps for quick and convenient storage. The walker's seat is also easily adjustable to three different heights, making this the ideal walker as your child grows. And best of all, the Grip'n Go Walker takes only minutes to assemble and requires no additional tools or special skills.The Ultimate Test DriveOur 9-month-old ""test baby"" learned to get around in the walker fairly quickly and was absolutely delighted with her newfound mobility. It's so mobile, in fact, that once you strap your baby into the walker, grown-ups and small pets will need to keep on their toes if they don't want to get run over! Our child, who is only now learning to crawl, suddenly became a fun-filled terror on wheels! We were also pleasantly surprised to discover that this walker makes a great stationary play station: simply put on the brakes and let your little one enjoy the attached toys to her heart's content. The included toys, with their whimsical, friendly faces, bendable bodies and fun blinking lights and sounds, provided our baby with loads of interactive, tactile fun. The front tray can easily serve as a spot for finger foods, or as a place to attach more toys to keep your child entertained safely in one spot while you attend to household chores or dinner. Also, we were relieved to find a toy that provided our child with tactile fun and exercise that required no batteries.The walker folds down in a few simple steps for quick, and convenient storage.View larger.A Brief Note on your Child's SafetyWhile the Grip'n Go Walker is built to provide your child with as healthy and safe an experience as she will ever experience in any walker, it's important to remember that these security measures do not replace adult supervision. Providing your baby with mobility requires constant parental supervision, so make certain never leave your baby unattended. Also, make sure that she is always on an even surface free of obstacles, and never allow your baby to use her walker near any stairs or steps. The Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker addresses several issues that older-model walkers neglected. The advanced safety features of the Grip'n Go Walker, combined with vigilant parental supervision, will give your child -- and yourself -- all the rewards that newfound mobility in a fun and playful setting can offer. In short, with vigilant parental supervision, the Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker can offer both parents and children the best of all worlds: it offers your child a safe and secure way to explore the world, while it gives you a safe and secure -- and stationary -- place to set your baby for those few moments you need a break.Pros:Provides infants with the exciting ability to explore the worldDoubles as a safe and secure stationary play stationDurable, lightweight, easy to use and maintainCons:Requires constant and vigilant adult supervision to ensure your child's safety"

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing.

14813,Baby,Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"The most important difference between the Medela Pump in Style Advanced model and the Original is that the Advanced pump includes a pretty remarkable feature that actually mimics a baby&#x92;s nursing rhythm by pumping in two distinct modes: let-down and expression. In the first few moments of nursing, babies initiate faster milk flow by suckling rapidly. After the flow is established, baby switches to slower, deeper suckling for maximum milk flow in less time. The ""Natural Expression"" system simulates this two-stage pattern for a highly efficient, effective pumping experience. In other ways the pump is similar to the also first-rate Original: a stylish and professional looking black shoulder bag houses the pump with adjustable speed and vacuum control, along with battery pack, AC adapter, four bottles with lids, bottle stands, ""PersonalFit"" breastshields, removable cooler carrier with ice packs, bottle holder, extra storage pockets, and a built-in picture frame for a photo of your pride and joy.

15368,Baby,Sunshine Kids New Radian80 Convertible Car Seat - Manhattan,"Radian80 is perhaps the strongest car seat in the world. No other car seat accommodates a child from birth to 80 lbs in a 5-point harness. And it's still the only car seat in the world that folds flat.  A high-capacity car seat has to be amazingly strong for a big child, but properly designed to provide the best performance for a small child.  It has to offer advanced safety features, the correct fit, plenty of comfort and proper support for a child at each stage. And it definitely needs to have the right styling because a 5 year old does not want to ride in a baby seat.  Finally, safety has to be convenient and easy to use, everyday. Radian80 does all this and more.  Radian's patented steel frame means no bulky plastic structure. Compared to other car seats, Radian offers more shoulder room, more leg support and fits three across in a car.  Many cars do not allow top tether use with a child above 48 lbs. That's why Radian 80 was designed for up to 80 lbs without a top tether, and the crash test results were fantastic.  SafeStop harness is a patented, energy absorbing harness system for added safety. SafeStop is a load-limiting harness device that absorbs crash energy impacting a child in an accident by reducing peak forces on the chest and neck by up to 30%. This is especially important because smaller children have higher head weight to body weight ratios."

The three-piece set is comprised of an infant carrier, a car seat base, and a stroller to outfit baby for either car or sidewalk travel. The infant carrier securely locks into the car seat base using Baby Trend&#x92;s tried-and-true Flex-Loc system or snaps rear-facing onto the front tray of the stroller for walks. Designed to carry babies from 5 to 22 pounds, the carrier has a strong five-point safety harness, a decent-sized canopy, and a rubber-coated triangular handle for an ergonomic, no-slip grip.The corresponding stroller navigates smoothly on two 9-inch back wheels and four 8-inch front wheels. A gigantic canopy provides ample shelter from sun and wind exposure and, when used with the carrier, meets the carrier&#x92;s canopy to completely blacken the area for a napping baby. Larger babies can sit right in the reclining stroller seat, which is padded for comfort, and rest their feet on the oversized footrest. For parents, there is a comfortable push bar that includes a quick-release button to collapse and fold the stroller using one hand.

16240,Baby,"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat, Puma","Britax International has been manufacturing innovative, industry-leading child products for over three decades. Their dedication to safety, comfort, and convenience is certainly apparent in this convertible car seat. The Roundabout has enough features for baby and parents to run rings around the competition.Safety first is a good rule of thumb, and one that Britax certainly heeds. The Roundabout offers features you might find on many other car seats, such as convertibility, a five-point harness, and the LATCH system. But Britax enhanced and then went above and beyond the norm when creating the functional and fashionable Roundabout.One-pull harness strap adjuster makes for a quick, easy, and snug fit every time.Their five-point harness system is made with strong polyester webbing, fits snugly over baby&#x92;s shoulders, collarbone and hips to provide a secure fit, and the straps are designed to remain tangle free. There are also three adjustable shoulder height positions so the car seat grows with baby. A patented ""floating"" HUGS (Harness Ultra Guard) system better distributes the webbing loads, reducing head movement and minimizing harness irritation on baby&#x92;s neck in case of an impact. HUGS also reduces the chance of improperly positioning the chest clip.Located near a vehicle's seatbelts, factory installed anchor points provide a secure and easy LATCH connection. In conjunction with this push-button release system, the Roundabout also offers Britax&#x92;s Versa-Tether&#xAE;, an anchor aid that works both rear- and forward-facing and prevents the seat from tilting in the event of an impact.Need more? The Roundabout provides built-in lock-off clips that keep the seat tightly in place when using only traditional seatbelts at installation. A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be easily reclined when rear-facing. The one-pull harness strap adjuster makes for a quick, easy, and snug fit every time. A comfy ride is guaranteed for baby through the special EPS impact foam padding and soft fabric cover, which is removable and washable. The Roundabout is Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 compliant, making it approved for use on airplanes as well.A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be reclined when rear-facing.The Roundabout&#x92;s versatile, contoured base means it will easily fit in almost every car, and can be positioned correctly every time, regardless of whether your vehicle is LATCH compatible or not. The car seat measures 18.25""W x 25""H x 23.5""D and weighs just less than 14 pounds when empty. Since car seats are mandated by law, it&#x92;s nice to know that Britax is at least making the decision simple. The Roundabout is easy to install, super comfortable for baby, available in a range of colors and patterns, and, most importantly, safe!Comparing Britax Car SeatsIf you&#x92;re debating between the Britax Roundabout and theBritax Marathon, think of the latter as the big brother. They are identical in comfort and convenience features, but the Marathon has a higher weight maximum and is larger than the Roundabout."

In addition, this Roundabout convertible child seat is a real money saver, taking your child from infancy all the way to kindergarten with one purchase. The seat can be used in the rear-facing position for infants and toddlers weighing between 5 and 33 pounds, and can also be turned around to face forward once children are one year old and weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. For safety, the Roundabout Convertible uses the LATCH restraint system and employs Britax&#x92;s patented Versa-Tether, which keeps the seat from tilting forward or backward during an impact. Soft Expanded PolyStyrene foam pads the head, torso, and seat area for both protection and comfort, and the fabric cover is removable for washing. A five-point harness secures children into the seat and has straps that adjust as kids grow. The Roundabout&#x92;s locking clips are a favorite feature for many parents because they never get twisted and make loading fidgety toddlers into the car much faster and easier.--Cristina Vaamonde"

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's in the BoxGraco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame."

Velcro attachments on the machine-washable covering also allows for a custom fit, based on the size--and preferences--of your baby.

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective and price competitive. Nature Babycare products good for babies. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and Gatherings"

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective, price competitive, and --making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for  baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables with the most  attributes.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

The first of its kind, Radian65 was conceptualized and designed around a set of strict safety and performance parameters.  With a steel alloy frame, Radian65 is the strongest, most advanced car seat available, and it's the only one in the world that folds flat.  Radian65 positions the child's center of gravity as low and as far back as possible on the vehicle seat for optimal restraint performance, especially in oblique-angled crashes, which is how most car accidents occur.  Radian's patented steel frame means no bulky plastic structure. Compared to other car seats, Radian offers more shoulder room, more leg support and fits three across in a car.  SafeStop harness is a patented, energy absorbing harness system for added safety. SafeStop is a load-limiting harness device that absorbs crash energy impacting a child in an accident by reducing peak forces on the chest and neck by up to 30%.

Three reclining positions and a three-point harness make feeding infants all the more possible, while the seven height adjustments mean the high chair will grow with your baby. And when your child is ready to move to the table, simply remove the tray and (while using the harness) push the chair up to the table as a booster seat.The feeding tray has a few tricks up its sleeve, as well. It has an easy, one-handed release/adjust, plus hides a little parent organizer that slides away. The organizer is great for keeping utensils and jars of food handy. The tray insert is extremely easy to clean; simply pop it out and throw it in the dishwasher. The Expressions Plus also has a handy towel bar to hang bibs and washcloths--another one of those small details you find yourself using more often than not.When you need the extra space (or if your baby has outgrown it), an easy-fold mechanism and the included tray stow on the back make this high chair compact for storing. The Expressions Plus requires some assembly out of the box, but the instructions are clear and concise, and total build time should not take more than an hour (considerably less if you have had practice putting products together). The durable and easy-to-use high chair packs a ton of features you would expect in a premium high chair at a fraction of the cost. Parents rave about the value of this particular high chair, and it is easy to see why. The manufacturer recommended age is birth to three years, up to a maximum weight of 40 pounds."

23467,Baby Products,Dr. Brown's Electric Breast Pump 1300,"From the Manufacturer
Unlike other pumps that tug and pull the nipple, the Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Electric Breast Pump works by using patented One-Way airflow in combination with a unique honeycomb liner that gently and rhythmically stimulates the nipple to increase Prolactin and Oxytocin production, which insures an increased milk supply, faster let-downs, and a healthier baby. Dr. Brown's Natural Flow breast pump is the only pump to offer this combination for mom and baby. 

Product Description
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Electric Breast Pump, utilizing Whittlestone(R) Hospital Technologies, is the first pump to truly simulate a baby expressing milk. Other breast pumps currently on the market utilize a Two-Way airflow, creating a ""suck and release"" motion that tugs and pulls on the mother's nipple. Conversely, when a baby is feeding at the breast, they express milk by latching, and using soft compressions with their tongue, mouth and jaw. Similarly, the Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Breast Pump's patented One-Way airflow in combination with its unique ultra-soft honeycomb liner rhythmically massages the areola, while gently compressing the nipple to increase Prolactin and Oxytocin production, which ensures an increased milk supply, better let down, and a healthier baby. Unlike Two-Way airflow pumps that can push germs into the breast through the open milk ducts, Dr. Brown's unique One-Way airflow continuously draws air and any present germs away from the breast, thus reducing the likelihood of breast infections. Clinically proven to provide pain-free relief of engorgement (an intense, painful swelling of the breasts), which allows mom to quickly and comfortably nurse her baby or pump. Dr. Brown's features large, easy-to-handle parts that make setup, use and cleaning fast and easy."

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective and price competitive--making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

For parents who don&#x92;t want to say goodbye to their outdoorsy life Before Baby, this diaper bag has your name on it. Be forewarned, though. Although it does contain a million (well, more like a dozen) compartments, you&#x92;ll have to be a pretty good packer to cram everything you and baby need into precisely the right space. Try to fit a jacket or extra toys into one of the ""main"" interior pockets, and that space is all used up. That said, for parents who figure out how to take advantage of the insulated soft-sided cooler at the base, the large insulated and mesh bottle holders, the bungee straps, the padded pouch, the toy loops, and the ""Baby Boudoir"" and first-aid pocket, this ergonomically designed pack is pretty darn cool. Naturally, it includes a changing pad&#x97;oversized and located at the back of the pack for extra cushioning for the backpack wearer. Although we love the idea of the built-in cooler for snacks, we wonder about the drain hole at the base&#x85;won&#x92;t any draining liquid dribble onto the carrier&#x92;s rear end?

As mom and dad supervise, the child gains the opportunity to get comfortable with basic independent decision making and movement. The Bumper Jumper also gives mom and dad the chance to do other things while keeping an eye on baby.The Bumper Jumper measures 17 x 69.5 inches (WxH) and weighs 3.5 pounds.About GracoIn 1942, Russell Gray and Robert Cone formed Graco Metal Products, in Philadelphia, PA. For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's in the BoxJumper with play tray and attaching clamp, cloth seat, and two attachable toys."

Most importantly, the Harmony is a safe and sanitary way to provide your baby with healthy breast milk--all parts that come into contact with breast milk are 100-percent BPA/DEHP free.

Little ones (up to 35 lbs.) will appreciate the stretch and give of cotton-Lycra, instead of the binding of more structured and buckled (ouch!) carriers. It also has a hidden, 3-point security harness that both balances mom&#x92;s weight, and supports baby&#x92;s frame. The manufacturers say the wrap is nice enough to wear alone as a top (if you must &#x85;) but with five positions--hip, back, torso, upright, or for nursing--parents won&#x92;t get into a fashion rut from wearing it all the time--which you might be tempted to do. The ingenious feature: thoughtful head and foot slots, to cover extremities on wet or nippy days. The downside: a couple of the positions, cozy though they are, would challenge Houdini. But that&#x92;s what the included instructional video is for.--Diane Beall"

Freeing baby&rsquo;s sleep environment of jarring or distracting outside noises is an important step in creating a soothing space for sleep. The Sound Sleeper provides just enough peaceful background noise to block household hubbub. Once baby becomes familiar with the sounds of this machine, she&rsquo;ll probably start yawning the minute she hears it!The Sounds of (Near) SilenceThe sounds of Sound Sleeper don&rsquo;t have to be boring, just relaxing and repetitive. Experiment with the various sounds to find the perfect soporific.Summer NightThe buzz of peeper frogs and insects is a happy, sleepy, country sound.RainWhat&rsquo;s cozier than curling up in bed with a gentle rainstorm pattering outside the window?BrookBurble, burble, burble&mdash;just don&rsquo;t try this one when your toddler is potty-training!OceanThe deep tranquility of a calm ocean is unmatched for its lulling ability.WindThe wind blows quietly in the trees, but you and baby are safe and sound at home.WombThe rhythmic swishing sounds of the womb: it&rsquo;s a natural for soothing baby!SeagullJust a few lonely seagull cries, widely spaced.BirdPretty, delicate bird song.BuoyThe distant ringing of a bell buoy. Great in combination with the Ocean sound.ThunderThunder rumbles, but the storm always stays far off in the distance. Best combined with Rain, of course.Experiment with the Combine mode to find the perfect sleep-inducing sounds for your baby. We like Brook and Bird, Wind and Thunder, and Ocean and Buoy, but who knows? Maybe the magic combination will be Womb and Seagull!The power adapter feature of the Sound Sleeper is very handy for everyday use. The ability to leave the sound machine on all night long (or put it on the one-hour timer) is invaluable. Babies are notorious for waking up throughout the night; when they hear the same soothing sounds they fell asleep to, it will be much easier to return to those sweet dreams.--Emilie Coulter"

It said that every year of a baby s life resulted in a mountain of used diapers weighing half a ton, every year. Half a ton! Even more disturbing was the fact that the traditional diapers were mainly made of plastic made from oil!! An oil product that comes in contact with the child s delicate skin. I got really upset.

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective and price competitive--making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables..What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

The set includes four 4-ounce bottles for between-meal feedings and eight 9-ounce bottles for heartier appetites. All bottles are fitted with Avent newborn nipples, which have a lower flow rate to prevent babies from swallowing too much air and getting gassy or colicky. Avent nipples are also designed to resemble the breast as closely as possible so Moms doing a combination of breast- and bottle-feeding often find this brand to be more widely accepted among breastfeeding babies. Along with the bottles is a bottle warmer that safely heats cold formula in four minutes or less without producing hot spots (as a microwave does) that can burn baby&#x92;s mouth. The final component is a bottle brush with an angled tip that gets in all corners for thorough and sanitary bottle cleaning.--Cristina Vaamonde"

33362,Baby,"Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","Britax International has been manufacturing innovative, industry-leading child products for over three decades. Their dedication to safety, comfort, and convenience is certainly apparent in this convertible car seat. Its ample attributes&#x97;both for parents and baby&#x97;and amazing attention to safety standards, make the Marathon a true front runner.Safety first is a good rule of thumb, and one that Britax certainly heeds. The Marathon offers features you might find on many other car seats, such as convertibility, a five-point harness, and the LATCH system. But Britax enhanced and then went above and beyond the norm when creating the Marathon.The Marathon can be easily rear-facing installed with today&#x92;s LATCH system.Their five-point harness system is made with strong polyester webbing, fits snugly over baby&#x92;s shoulders, collarbone and hips to provide a secure fit, and the straps are designed to remain tangle free. There are also four adjustable height positions so the seat grows with baby. A patented ""floating"" HUGS&#x99; (Harness Ultra Guard) system better distributes the webbing loads, reducing head movement and minimizing harness irritation on baby&#x92;s neck in case of an impact. HUGS also reduces the chance of improperly positioning the chest clip.Located near a vehicle's seatbelts, factory installed anchor points provide a secure and easy LATCH connection. In conjunction with this push-button release system, the Marathon also offers Britax&#x92;s Versa-Tether&#xAE;, an anchor aid that provides additional security in the forward facing position for children weighing more than 50 lbs. The Versa-Tether&#xAE; fastens the top of the car seat to factory installed automobile anchor points, minimizing the possibility of a head injury.The Marathon can also be safely used in cars without the LATCH system.Need more? The Marathon provides built-in lock-off clips that keep the seat tightly in place when using only traditional seatbelts at installation. A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be easily reclined when rear-facing. A smooth ride is guaranteed for baby through the comfy padding and soft fabric cover, which is stain resistant, removable, and washable. The Marathon is Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 compliant, making it approved for airplane use as well.It should be noted that the Marathon is larger (28""H x 19.5""W x 25""D) than most car seats, and can be a tricky fit, especially in the rear facing position in a smaller car. Allow for 31"" of backseat space to properly accommodate this model. With its bigger size this car seat is also heavier than many. Completely empty the Marathon weighs nearly 18 pounds. But these same features are what allow the car seat to have a higher weight capacity and therefore last well into childhood.A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be reclined when rear-facing.Since car seats are mandated by law, it&#x92;s nice to know that Britax is at least making the choice simple for you. The Marathon is easy to install, super comfortable for baby, available in a wide range of colors and patterns, and, most importantly, safe!Comparing Britax Car SeatsIf you&#x92;re debating between the Britax Marathon and theBritax Roundabout, think of the latter as the little sibling. They are identical in comfort and convenience features, but the Marathon has a higher weight maximum, and is therefore larger than the Roundabout.TheBritax Decathlonis also similar to the Marathon, but offers two features you might need. First, the Decathlon offers additional padding for newborns with an infant positioning system, giving more peace of mind to first time parents. Second, the Decathlon offers an adjustable three-position crotch strap, which makes the seat more comfortable for toddlers consistently at the top of their height percentage."

Plush and soft, with a sturdy plastic shell, this nightlight is best placed on the floor in the center of the room, where it projects a starry night sky onto the ceiling and walls. For interactive fun, parents can also sit with their children and identify and describe the features of eight major constellations, including the Big Dipper and the Big Bear, with the help of the beautifully illustrated Star Guide. The Twilight Turtle also includes a warm-hearted story about how Twilight Turtle, separated from his father, uses the constellations to find his way home.User-Friendly OperationSimply pressing the button on the turtle's shell ignites the stars and keeps them glowing for a full 45 minutes--just enough time for most children to drift into sleep. At this point, the Twilight Turtle automatically shuts off to preserve battery life. Another push of the button reactivates the projection. In addition, the easy selection of the three soothing color choices allows your child not only to learn to identify different colors, but also to truly experience them as well. Amber radiates warmth and peace; green creates a healing and renewing atmosphere; and blue helps calm the senses. The soft, illuminating glow the Twilight Turtle emits also serves as a nightlight that makes the darkness less frightening.Makes a Great GiftA great gift for children who are afraid of the dark, or even adults who have trouble falling asleep, the Twilight Turtle runs on three ""AAA"" batteries (included). It also comes with a certification of adoption, and measures a compact 14.0 x 5.0 inches (WxH), so it's easy to display and store.About Cloud bCloud b, the baby sleep specialist, was established by two new mothers with the philosophy that every baby deserves a sound night's sleep for healthy development.

Baby can pull its ears, which make a crinkly sound that babies like, and feel its nubby nose, as well as explore the other soft textures on the mat. And because babies are fascinated with bold, contrasting imagery and with facial features, your infant will also like looking at the monkey's big, black-and-white eyes.Your baby can lie on the mat on his back to interact with the activity arch above. It features three bright, interesting, and interactive toys, including a plush zebra, a baby-proof mirror that gives baby the opportunity to discover his own face, and a cute monkey that plays a short melody when you pull its tail.When you and your baby are finished playing, you can easily zip up the mat to store it away. The activity arch detaches easily and can be quickly installed over your baby's crib, making for more versatile use.A Toy to Grow with Your Little OneThe Merry Monkey Gym offers plenty of opportunity for growing and learning. We especially like that the characters on the activity bar are angled to make important ""eye contact"" with the baby, which isn't always the case with activity mats. This mat also encourages the ""tummy time"" that pediatricians recommend for infants for strengthening neck and arm muscles. Unlike some other mats, the Merry Monkey provides enticements for your baby to spend more time on his tummy with its interesting colors, textures, and fabrics.The Merry Monkey is designed to grow with your little one through several stages of his early development: as a newborn he'll love just looking at the characters and watching you interact with the toys -- but before you know it, he'll be reaching for them himself with his hands and feet, and rolling over on his own to play with the monkey's ears.Finally, this activity mat's compact size and relatively inexpensive price tag make the Merry Monkey an economical choice. It is a bit smaller than other activity mats on the market, which give your baby a bit more room to play, but its compact size makes it easy to store and carry without sacrificing fun or educational quality."

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective and price competitive--making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

34346,Baby,Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat - Freestyle Mint,"Designed for use with the Pliko P3 Freestyle stroller, this 2006 Primo Viaggio infant car seat is brandishing a few updates from last year&#x97;both in style and safety. As with all Peg Perego products, this car seat is a model of sophisticated Italian design. Several dreamy new pastel and black color combinations satisfy the fashionable quota of every hip mama&#x92;s checklist. However, convenience and safety factor heavily into the recent design changes as well. A larger seat accommodates bigger babies or takes smaller babies a little further along until they reach 22 pounds or 30 inches. Plush padding not only cradles infants in ultimate comfort but keeps them safer. The nylon shell and wing-style headrest are filled with Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) foam for better energy absorption in an impact; plus the side-impact protection is adjustable to five positions to ensure it&#x92;s at the proper height as baby grows. A car seat base is included for installation in a vehicle and secures with either LATCH or a seatbelt. However, the car seat may be safely secured without the base, making it useful for airplane or rental car travel when vacationing. As always, the Primo Viaggio has a 5-point harness&#x97;only now it is easier to adjust with just one hand. Other convenient features include an adjustable handle and hood, a separate padded foot cover to warm baby&#x92;s feet in winter months, and a rain shield to keep baby dry during transport on stormy days. And, the drawbacks to this car seat? It is heavier than competing models and requires two hands to adjust the carrying handle; therefore, it is not recommended for carrying any further than the car or the stroller. In addition, the Primo Viaggio does not have multiple reclining positions so baby will need to be content with just one.--Cristina Vaamonde"

35064,Baby Products,12 Pack One Size Cloth Diapers Girl Colors -NEW COLORS,"The FuzziBunz One-Size Diapers are the most adjustable and innovative one-size cloth diapers on the market today! Adjust the diapers to fit babies 7-35 pounds and get a snug fit every time with the button-adjusted waist and leg casings. The leg casings adjust to 8+ settings and the waist adjusts to 4+ settings. Never before has a pocket-style cloth diaper been SO adjustable! And the great thing about FuzziBunz is that they always use sturdy snap closures which will withstand 3+ years of use and elastic that is easily replaceable if it ever fails making it a long standing and dependable diapering system for years to come. ADJUSTABILITY The FUZZIBUNZ ONE SIZE diaper uses adjustable elastic, NOT snap downs on the front of the diaper like most one size diapers on the market. Similar to adjustable waistbands for kids and maternity wear, the waist and legs have been made customizable through a button/elastic adjustment system. So instead of 3 length settings, you can set to 8+ customizable sizes. Instead of NO waist settings, you have up to 4+. So you have a SUPER adjustable diaper without an excess of snaps. It may take a bit of ""adjusting"" to get to the right size, but when you find the right fit, you set it and forget it. THE TRUTH FuzziBunz offers both Perfect Sized and Birth to Potty diapers. Each have their pros and cons. We believe in ""truth in advertising"". If a trim fitting diaper is important to you then the perfect sized diapers may be suited best for you-most babies only use 2 sizes of diapers (small and medium). If a diaper that will last from birth to potty, and will stand up to three years of use and possibly more is what you value....and you are willing to sacrifice some trimness for this-then the One Size may be your diaper of choice."

It is therefore versatile enough for almost any car. Foam padding protects the head and sides, while two reclining positions make the ride even more enjoyable. The one caveat: the seat&#x92;s floral design may match your grandmother&#x92;s upholstered sofa from 20 years ago.

The foam is covered by a quilted vinyl layer that is moisture and stain resistant--an obvious necessity in changing pads--but when put to the test, the contoured changing pad beaded moisture and wiped clean with a pass of a cloth. This makes cleaning and disinfecting a snap.Easily attach the Baby Comfort Ultra Plush changing pad cover.The three-inch beveled sides keep baby in a comfortable and compliant position while changing a diaper. The security strap buckles over the torso to keep baby from rolling and affords peace of mind when turning to grab some wipes.The pad is standard-sized--it generally fits most changing tables, or it can be used on any counter or surface. For stationary use, the changing pad can be screwed to the wall, or take advantage of the non-slipping bottom for use on any surface. The no-skid bottom works exactly as advertised.The contoured changing pad is large enough to accommodate baby until she is a toddler (birth to 24 months). The standard sizing of the pad also means that most generic changing pad covers fit, or you can extend the life of this pad with the Baby Comfort ultra plush changing pad covers (not included). The Velboa fabric--you know, the soft, almost-fur like synthetic fabric that is machine-washable--of the Basic Comfort changing pad covers is also stain resistant, and the covers fit this changing pad like a glove.The Basic Comfort contoured changing pad is designed especially for baby, and parents couldn't be any happier. --Scott Teal"
38720,Baby,"Britax Roundabout 40 Convertible Car Seat, Aloha","Britax International has been manufacturing innovative, industry-leading child products for over three decades. Their dedication to safety, comfort, and convenience is certainly apparent in this convertible car seat. The Roundabout has enough features for baby and parents to run rings around the competition.Safety first is a good rule of thumb, and one that Britax certainly heeds. The Roundabout offers features you might find on many other car seats, such as convertibility, a five-point harness, and the LATCH system. But Britax enhanced and then went above and beyond the norm when creating the functional and fashionable Roundabout.One-pull harness strap adjuster makes for a quick, easy, and snug fit every time.Their five-point harness system is made with strong polyester webbing, fits snugly over baby&#x92;s shoulders, collarbone and hips to provide a secure fit, and the straps are designed to remain tangle free. There are also three adjustable shoulder height positions so the car seat grows with baby. A patented ""floating"" HUGS (Harness Ultra Guard) system better distributes the webbing loads, reducing head movement and minimizing harness irritation on baby&#x92;s neck in case of an impact. HUGS also reduces the chance of improperly positioning the chest clip.Located near a vehicle's seatbelts, factory installed anchor points provide a secure and easy LATCH connection. In conjunction with this push-button release system, the Roundabout also offers Britax&#x92;s Versa-Tether&#xAE;, an anchor aid that works both rear- and forward-facing and prevents the seat from tilting in the event of an impact.Need more? The Roundabout provides built-in lock-off clips that keep the seat tightly in place when using only traditional seatbelts at installation. A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be easily reclined when rear-facing. The one-pull harness strap adjuster makes for a quick, easy, and snug fit every time. A comfy ride is guaranteed for baby through the special EPS impact foam padding and soft fabric cover, which is removable and washable. The Roundabout is Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 compliant, making it approved for use on airplanes as well.A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be reclined when rear-facing.The Roundabout&#x92;s versatile, contoured base means it will easily fit in almost every car, and can be positioned correctly every time, regardless of whether your vehicle is LATCH compatible or not. The car seat measures 18.25""W x 25""H x 23.5""D and weighs just less than 14 pounds when empty. Since car seats are mandated by law, it&#x92;s nice to know that Britax is at least making the decision simple. The Roundabout is easy to install, super comfortable for baby, available in a range of colors and patterns, and, most importantly, safe!Comparing Britax Car SeatsIf you&#x92;re debating between the Britax Roundabout and theBritax Marathon, think of the latter as the big brother. They are identical in comfort and convenience features, but the Marathon has a higher weight maximum and is larger than the Roundabout."

Each BabyChime comes with a 34"" sterling silver chain and a card explaining the BabyChime history and purpose.The BabyChime is a handcrafted sterling silver maternity pendant designed to symbolize the pregnancy and help the mom (and dad-to-be) establish the first bond with baby.&lt;p&gt; The BabyChime hangs from a 34 inch silver necklace so that it rests  and dances  on the mommys growing belly, never far from baby. Anytime during the pregnancy the mom-to-be, or her partner, regularly moves the chime over the belly to generate the gentle calming sound of the chime. Upon birth, the baby can recognize the BabyChime sound and associate the soothing chime with the feelings of being in the womb, such as comfort and security, and experience peace and serenity.Research shows that babies start reacting to some outside sounds as early as 14 weeks, with the ability to fully hear by 24 weeks, and that babies can recognize sounds heard in the womb after birth, becoming calmer and more self-regulated when exposed to the intrauterine sound. These sounds are of importance because they can establish the first patterns of communication and bonding (Life Before Birth, Whitwell).&lt;p&gt; The Baby Chime also makes a beautiful and timeless keepsake for the mother to remember those special nine months of her pregnancy."

40420,Toys & Games,Fisher-Price Bright Beginnings Baby Baseball,"Batter up! This little baseball tee proves it's never too early to start swinging. For true beginners, snap a softened baseball to the plug atop the 9.5-inch tee. As baby swings at the ball with the 7.5-inch easy-grip, hollow, bulbous plastic bat, the ball will stay in place while the tee wobbles on its roly-poly base. When baby is ready for more action, the ball can rest freely atop the tee and she or he can send it soaring--or at least knock it off the tee! As baby grows into a toddler, the tee can be adjusted to proper height, with a pull and a twist, and your child can practice the ""step up, wind up, and swing"" maneuver. The air-filled plastic ball produces a squeak when it's squeezed, and the classic raised red baseball stitching makes it easy for little fingers to grasp.--Kathryn Gustafson"

41425,Baby,"Britax Parkway Booster Car Seat, Brownstone","Britax International has been manufacturing innovative, industry-leading child products for over three decades. Their dedication to safety, comfort, and convenience is apparent in every aspect of this functional and fashionable booster seat. Parents will love being able to effortlessly secure their child in the car and the peace of mind that comes with Britax&#x92;s renowned attention to safety standards. Children will love that the Parkway is comfortable from day one, adjusts to stay that way, and has amenities just for them.Before we get into the features of the Parkway, it should be noted that booster seats are meant to be used with standard, factory-installed lap and shoulder belts in your vehicle. Booster seats do not use LATCH or any other tether system, but are secured by the child&#x92;s weight and a properly buckled seatbelt. The Parkway is meant to give occupants a ""boost"" so that the car&#x92;s seatbelt can sit safely across their torso.Safety first is a good rule of thumb, and one that Britax certainly heeds. The belt-positioning Parkway booster seat was designed for increased safety, incorporating deep torso and adjustable height head support. The multi-position headrest is simple to work with only one hand and allows the seat to grow with your child, up to 60"" tall. Your child is too tall for the Parkway once the tops of their ears are above the top of the fully raised headrest.The multi-position headrest can be easily adjusted with just one hand.The Parkway also features Britax-engineered True Side Impact Protection. It has been confirmed through rigorous side impact sled testing to better contain a child in dangerous, side-impact crashes. The reinforced headrest is lined with EPS foam to absorb energy, and its design cradles the child&#x92;s head to keep it away from protruding parts and minimize and cushion violent side to side movements. The Parkway meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213, a set of strict standards to which child restraint systems must adhere.With safety clearly taken care of, Britax moved on to comfort and convenience features. The Parkway&#x92;s seat shape correctly positions the lap belt over your child&#x92;s pelvis while the color-coded belt guides keeps the vehicle&#x92;s belt comfortably away from their neck. The plush fabric seat cover is removable and washable, and comes in a range of colors and patterns. Drink and snack trays are easily accessible. The reclining backrest allows your child to be in ultimate comfort on long trips or when sleeping. The base of the booster seat is contoured and slip-resistant, providing additional peace of mind. When empty, the Parkway weighs a mere 10 pounds, making it a cinch to move between vehicles when necessary."

For this carrier, most of the child's weight rests on your hips and the lightly padded straps that cross over the shoulders can be wrapped several different ways to help the user find the most comfortable position for him/herself.  Complete wearing instructions are included to help you find the best method of carrying your baby."

41664,Baby,Fisher-Price: 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights Monitor,"Nervous, first-time parents will appreciate the extreme sensitivity of the Sound &#x91;n Lights monitor. This single-receiver monitor provides two ways to check on what baby is up to in her crib. The sound is clear as a bell so parents can hear even the slightest noises, such as baby&#x92;s breathing or rolling over in her crib, and cries come through loud and strong. As a secondary measure, the receiver also features a light display to keep tabs on baby. A single arc of light on the display suggests that baby is quiet or asleep while a swift climb to four arcs means that baby is most likely making a lot of noise. This light feature is a blessing for parents whose babies cry themselves to sleep as parents can ""see"" if their child is quieting down without having to listen to agonizing screams. Further features include a power indicator light on the base, a volume control, two channels to reduce interference, and the option of using the AC adapter or three ""AA"" batteries (not included) for power.

The crossed straps are easy to tighten for comfort as there is only one adjustment to make: simply pull the strap ends on either side until the carrier is fitted against the body and crossed at a comfortable place along the back. Straps are padded with a patented honeycomb-shaped rubber material called Intelligel that truly alleviates much of the stress on the neck and shoulders by distributing baby&#x92;s weight across the strongest part of the back. Baby slips in through one side of the carrier and is held snugly in place with easy-to-operate buckles by the arms and a combination of Velcro closures and buckles by the legs. All closures are fairly easy to secure even if baby is particularly wiggly. Baby can ride facing Mom if he is snoozing and or looking out if he is alert and curious. A detachable pillow supports baby&#x92;s head during the earlier months and a zippered pouch holds a sun and rain hood in case of sudden weather changes. This carrier supports 8 to 26 pounds and can take most babies from the newborn stage up to almost 2 years old.--Cristina Vaamonde"

Premium push-button LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) connectors provide a quick, simple and secure installation, while the tangle-free, durable polyester, five-point harness with four harness heights ensures a snug fit as your baby grows. Convenient belt holders keep the harness to the side when you're placing the child in the seat.Once your child is seated, rear- and forward-facing recline allows for additional comfort and proper positioning, while the additional padding creates overall cozy support that's particularly ideal for newborns. As your baby grows, the adjustable three-position crotch strap also helps make things more comfortable. Finally, removable head and body pillows adjust for a custom fit throughout your child's development.HUGS and Versa-Tether for Optimum Safety and SupportWhen it comes to safety, the Decathlon truly delivers. First, the patented floating HUGS (Harness Ultra Guard) system exceeds U.S. safety standards by reducing forward head movement as it gently cushions the neck and chest with soft padding--a feature that's particularly important both in the case of an accident and during nap time. In addition, this system better distributes the webbing loads, restricting head movement and minimizing harness irritation on baby's neck in case of an impact. HUGS also reduces the chance of improperly positioning the chest clip. Secondly, the patented Versa-Tether fastens the top of the car seat to factory installed automobile anchor points, reducing the possibility of a head injury. This system also allows for rear-facing tethering to help keep the seat stable.Easy Adjustments for a Custom-FitWhether your vehicle is LATCH compatible or not, the Decathlon provides built-in lock-off clips that keep the seat tightly in place when using only traditional seatbelts for installation. There's also a simple handle pull that allows the car seat to be easily reclined. The one-pull harness strap adjuster makes for a quick and snug fit every time. Newborns benefit from the infant positioning system, super comfy padding, and a soft belly pad. Older children can kick back and relax with the toddler head pillow and soft fabric cover, which is removable and washable.Weighing just 15.5 pounds and measuring 19.5 x 27.5 x 25.5 inches (WxHxD), the Decathlon is Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 compliant, which means it adheres to strict quality control and safety guidelines, and is also approved for airplane travel. The Decathlon comes with a 1-year limited warranty."

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective, price competitive--making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables .What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

43545,Baby,Miracle Blanket Green With Beige Trim,"At last, the perfect swaddle made easy!

Miracle Blanket earned the ""thumbs up"" from the Good Housekeeping Institute. Uses no velcro, zippers or other confusing adjustments that can scratch baby and one size fits all. New research shows the benefits of swaddling to calm baby and help ensure longer sleep but the Miracle Blanket makes it easy. It truly is amazing. The Miracle Blanket is made of the highest quality (and cozy) materials available and is stitched with great attention to detail. The Miracle Blanket helps baby sleep on his back to reduce SIDS concerns and clinical studies prove that proper swaddling can often eliminate colic symptoms. Yet most blankets do not provide for a secure swaddle and baby often manages to squirm loose. The Miracle Blanket is easy to use and keeps baby snug. Pediatrician recommended.

44334,Baby,Evenflo Whisper Connect 900Mhz 2-Way Nursery Monitor,"All parents want the security of knowing their baby is safe and sound&#x85;asleep. But chores must be done, friends must be entertained, and, well, parents have to sleep sometimes, too. A good, reliable baby monitor can be key to a family&#x92;s happiness and productivity. Life goes on after baby goes to sleep, and mom and dad don&#x92;t have to run in to check on their little angel every five minutes. The Evenflo Whisper Connect 2-Way Nursery Monitor is one of the best monitors around. The 900Mhz two-channel operation minimizes static and interference, so baby&#x92;s voice&#x97;and even her breathing&#x97;come in loud and clear. The two-way walkie-talkie feature allows parents to talk to their fussy children if they can&#x92;t get to them immediately. Sometimes this connection is all baby needs to get back to sleep! A whopping 650-foot operational range (depending on battery power and possible obstructions) gives parents the freedom to move about their home, or even outside, while baby sleeps. Alarms go off and lights flash when the parental unit goes out of range, so parents will always know their wandering limits. A nice little money-saving and mobility-enhancing benefit to this system is the option to unplug the parental receiver unit AC adapter and use the rechargeable batteries (already in the unit). Other nifty features:Channel A/BIf interference occurs, change both the baby&#x92;s transmitter unit and the parental receiver unit to the alternate frequency channel. (Since the WhisperConnect Nursery Monitor operates over public airwaves, it is possible for transmissions from other products broadcasting on the same frequency to be picked up by both units.)Sound LightsSound Lights light up when the parent&#x92;s unit receives sounds. The more lights are lit up, the louder the sounds. One light may be a snuffle or murmur in baby&#x92;s sleep. Seven lights will probably be the full-on ""I-want-my-mommy!"" howl. This can be a useful feature when the parental unit volume is turned down low. Just make sure the monitor is in plain view!Low Battery IndicatorWhen the rechargeable battery power in the parent unit runs low, a low batter indicator light will flash. To recharge, simply attach the AC adapter to the parent&#x92;s unit, plug the adapter into a standard wall outlet, then set the Power/Volume Dial to ""on.""Out-of-Range Indicator and AlarmThe Out-of-Range Indicator and Alarm will go off not only when the units are taken out of range of each other, but also when the units are set to different channels, power to the baby&#x92;s unit is lost, or a strong interfering signal starts on the selected channel.Parent Unit FinderPress the ""Finder"" button on the baby&#x92;s unit to activate the locating signal. Once the parent unit is found, turn the power switch off then on to deactivate the signal. If only finding your human co-parental unit was so easy!Additional Receivers AvailableThe more the merrier!

45212,Baby,Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat Fleetwood,"Babies require so many things that they seem to outgrow as soon as they start using them. Diapers, clothes, toys, carriers, strollers -- you name it. As any parent knows, this can be a real strain on a family's budget. So it's a real bonus to find a high-quality, necessary baby product that is designed to ""grow"" with your child and last years, rather than a few weeks or months.The Evenflo Tribute 5 Child Restraint System is a convertible car seat: unlike most infant travel-system car seats that are designed only to be used for the child's first 12 months, this unique car restraint system is can meet the needs of your and your child for the first three years of her life. Install it in your car before you go to the hospital to deliver the baby . . . . and you may not have to buy another system until well past her third birthday!A comfortable and high quality car restraint system designed for front- and rear-facing placement.View larger.View different angle.Quick and easy installation using either the car's seat belts or the LATCH system.View product demo.Long-Lasting Safety and ComfortThe Evenflo Tribute 5 Child Restraint System is built with safety in mind: it meets all the stringent requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 2123. Install the car seat in the back seat of your vehicle using either the car's seat belts or the LATCH system that is available in newer vehicles. The convertible car seat is designed for both rear-facing placement -- required for your baby until she is one year old, over 19 inches in height and 20 pounds in weight -- and forward-facing placement, to be used once your child reaches her first birthday and weighs between 20 and 40 pounds.(Note: Your baby must weigh at least five pounds to use this car seat, so you should consult your pediatrician for the best child restraint system if your infant was born prematurely or weighs less than five pounds. )Once the car seat is installed, your baby will ride in style. In the rear-facing position, you can use the special foot-designed recline to adjust the car seat, or keep it in an upright position. The car seat's plush upholstery provides an extra-comfy ride, and the soft, removable padding provides a snugger fit and extra security for your smaller infant. The upholstery is easily spot cleaned or machine washable, which you will be thankful for after the many inevitable diaper disasters, spit-ups, and teething biscuit crumbles that you will endure in your child's early years. And the car seat's modern design and stylish, neutral color scheme will also complement the interior of any vehicle. As an added bonus, this car seat also meets all FAA requirements for use on an airplane.The Ultimate Test DriveOur test vehicle required that we install the car seat with the car's seat belts, which we found relatively simple thanks to the easy-to-follow directions, both in the forward-facing and rear-facing positions. The 5-point safety belt was a snap to use and was also easily adjusted to accommodate our test baby's height. Our 9-month-old tester traveled happily in comfortable style, and we felt completely confident and comfortable with her security.One slight drawback is that compared with the infant seats sold with most travel systems, this seat is not as easy to remove if you want to transfer it to another vehicle, and it's not as convenient as the systems that allow you to use the seat as a baby carrier outside of the vehicle. However, if a reliable, long-lasting car seat that you will not have to replace for at least three years is what you're looking for, the Evenflo Convertible Car Seat is the choice for you.Pros:Designed for baby's use from birth until about three years of ageWorks with newer vehicles' LATCH systemInstalls easilyPlush and comfortable padding is machine washableCons:Lacks the convenient portability of ""travel system"" infant carriersSomewhat time-consuming to transfer to other vehicles"

45258,Toys & Games,Small World Toys Clutch Ball  - Colors vary,"As infants begin to discover their world, they must first  investigate their own senses. This soft clutch ball tantalizes all five  of a baby's senses.
