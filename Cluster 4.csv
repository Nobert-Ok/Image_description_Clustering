The unit also contains a full-featured, all-digital answering machine.We compliment the VTech designers on their intelligent, intuitive product, as we were able to set up and use the phone's features by guesswork alone. You control the phone with the 12 buttons and one switch on the base and with the 11 buttons on the handset (in addition to the usual 0 through 9, #, and *). After plugging in the phone and inserting the rechargeable ni-cad battery pack, we pressed the Menu, Select, and Time/Set buttons to set the date, time, number of rings, announce mode, audible message alert, and the base-ringer mode. The VTech's voice prompts helped enormously during this process. Setting the greeting was harder, taking us about five minutes to discover that pressing the Memo button records the message. However, we easily discovered the handset's caller-ID functions without consulting the instructions.The answering-machine functions were as intuitive as the phone itself. In our tests, we found that the time limit is 90 seconds for the outgoing message, four minutes for a single memo or incoming message, and just under 16 minutes for total recording time.In our distance test, the handset provided excellent clarity with no distortion or buzzing to about 250 feet, at which point the signal began to cut in and out. The handset stopped functioning at about 530 feet, which is normal for phones in this class.Given the easy setup and the great signal quality within reasonable distance limits, we give the VTech VT 1970ci high praise.Pros:Easy to set up and learnModern stylingGreat feature setCons:Total record time of less than 16 minutes"

2504,All Electronics,Ampli-Phone Passive Speaker for iPhone,"The Ampli-Phone is a scientifically designed horn that provides remarkable amplification of the speaker built into your iPhone, iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS. The Ampli-Phone provides more than 18 dB broadband gain as compared to an iPhone without the horn, and low frequency response is extended by a full octave. The sound is full and very pleasing, and the Ampli-Phone makes a very satisfactory home or office accessory.

The Ampli-Phone is great for listening to music, either from your iPod library or from one of the many streaming audio sites such as AOL Radio or Pandora. When watching movies, the speaker can be rotated on its side so that the iPhone screen is in landscape mode. The horn will point slightly upwards, directing the sound towards your ear and positioning the screen at a convenient angle for viewing. 
On the nightstand, the Ampli-Phone will amplify the iPhone's alarm, ensuring that you do not oversleep. 
In the office, the Ampli-Phone can be used to amplify the iPhone's built in speakerphone. Conference calls are easy, and everyone gathered around the table can hear and be heard. 
The Ampli-Phone can be used inside or outside. It is lightweight, and easily transported with the iPhone attached. The phone is held securely in the rubber dock, and won't fall out accidentally.
Because the Ampli-Phone is purely acoustic, it uses no batteries or wires. 

Besides the distinct advantage of an amplifier that uses no power, the Ampli-Phone offers other benefits. No shielding is required to prevent electrical interference from the phone, such as is commonly experienced with traditional phone amplifiers. The Ampli-Phone is rugged and lightweight, and inherently very reliable, since it contains no components. 

The Ampli-Phone is designed so that all of the phone's functions remain available. You can adjust any controls, and charge or sync the phone while it is in place on the Ampli-Phone (using the cable that came with the iPhone)."

2992,Cell Phones & Accessories,PCS Phone Samsung I330 (Sprint),"The Samsung i330 is one of the standouts emerging from a breed of smartphones that are cropping up to fill the market niche for a single pocket-sized device for dialing and computing. Samsung&#x92;s second foray into the handheld market, the i330 runs on the Palm OS platform and replaces the i300 with a slimmer profile, a boost in power, and some additional options.Sized halfway between a PDA and phone (measuring 4.9 by 2.4 by .7 inches), the i330 is light and slim enough to hold during a marathon phone conversation and has curved, rubberized sides for a comfortable grip. Additionally, the 256-color,160-by-240 graphic LCD screen is large enough to perform computing tasks easily with the included stylus.Running on the Palm OS 3.5.3, the icon-based layout is familiar, and shows 12 icons (out of 18) at a time. Two central buttons on the lower end of the phone offer manual scrolling up or down through icons and four other buttons take you directly to your memos, to-do list, address book, and calendar. Additional preset icons at the bottom of the screen take you to the main menu, phone book, calculator, and find button. We found the speakerphone function in particular was quite handy, for it let us access PDA functions while continuing our conversation.Calls made from our home and our car were clear, but the ringer on the i330 was a little bit quiet on its loudest setting and was a bit muffled when the phone rang from a handbag. The voice-activated dialing feature, however, recognized our voice, even with a loud TV blaring in the background, and put our call through immediately. The phone keypad on the i330 is on the touchscreen, and we found that error-free dialing was much more likely with the stylus than with our fingers. However, the i330 does have hot keys so you can dial directly from the phone book without the stylus if you choose. Additional icons at the bottom of the phone screen access a list of the last 10 outgoing calls, turn on the mute button, activate speed dial, and control the keyguard.The i330 comes with a fast 66 mHz Dragonball processor designed to get the most out of CDMA 1XRTT wireless networks, allowing an average speed of 144 kbps for data transfer. The large screen made it a pleasure to download Web content &#x96; everything from news sites to flight information.The i330 comes with a cradle that dually works for charging the smartphone and synchronizing its data with Microsoft Outlook on a desktop computer. Loaded with 16 MB of RAM, the phone has enough memory to hold data for the average user. Other available features for the i330 include a digital camera and a keyboard for enhancing the phone&#x92;s capabilities.Overall, we recommend this phone to business users who are looking for a PDA/phone unit in a smaller size than usual but that still allows for loads of usability.--Cristina VaamondePros:Offers complete business solutionSized for comfortable phone or PDA useIntuitive Palm OS platformAdditional accessories include digital camera, keyboardCons:Touchscreen a tad sticky at timesQuiet ringerHow We Tested Battery Talk/Standby TimeWhen reading our reviews, you should view the test results of mobile-phone  battery talk time and standby time as relative information only. Many variables,  including carrier signal strength at your location, signal consistency  (including incoming and outgoing calls), display and ringer settings, and  battery charging methods and history, will affect performance. When handset  manufacturers and mobile phone carriers list talk-time and standby-time ratings,  they usually include disclaimers about variable performance and often refer to  the times they publish as maximum times. Some quote expected battery life  ranges, and in this case you're probably safe to assume you'll experience at  least the minimum rated range. Note that manufacturers of dual-mode digital and  analog handsets publish battery-life rates for both digital and analog modes, as  analog mode consumes much more power than digital mode.Our Tests:We tested digital-mode talk and standby times with each phone.  Prior to each test, we fully charged the phone's battery according to the  manufacturer's directions. To test digital-phone talk time, we turned the phone  on, established a digital carrier signal, dialed a number in our test lab, and,  when the call rang through, took the receiving phone's handset off the hook.  When all went well, we didn't do anything else except record the time when the  phone died. In a couple of cases, the phones lost the signal and dropped the  calls. If we were right there and could redial, we did so immediately and  continued running the test. Otherwise, we halted the test, recharged the  battery, and started the test over. Assuming consistent carrier-signal strength,  this test should represent best-case talk time. And it's worth noting that  several phones' talk-time performance significantly exceeded the manufacturers'  ratings.To test digital-phone standby time, we turned the phone on, established a  carrier signal, and left the phone in standby mode. We checked the phone every  few hours (for what was often days on end) until the phone finally cut out.  Since no outgoing or incoming calls occurred during testing and because the  phone was not moved, this method should represent best-case standby time, again  assuming consistent carrier signal strength."

3070,Office Products,Southwestern Bell GH2430MS 2.4 GHz Cordless Answerer with Caller ID,"Get the convenience of a digital answering system plus state-of-the-art, 2.4 GHz digital spread-spectrum (DSS) cordless technology with the Southwestern Bell Freedom Phone GH2430MS. With its stylish look, caller-ID/call-waiting capability, and convenient features, this phone is an affordable introduction to 2.4 GHz DSS cordless technology.This Southwestern Bell cordless takes advantage of the higher-frequency 2.4 GHz range of the FM radio spectrum, opened to cordless phones only in 1998. The GH2430MS is basically an FM transmitter/receiver using shorter wavelengths, so radio waves encounter less interference. The 2.4 GHz frequency is also far above the range accessible to most scanners, so there's less risk of eavesdropping.When you add DSS technology to a 2.4 GHz cordless, you get the best security and clarity currently available. Based in part on a concept invented by 1940s screen actress Hedy Lamarr, spread-spectrum transmission switches rapidly from frequency to frequency at random. A DSS signal needs less power and encounters less interference. The GH2430MS's auto-scan feature automatically switches between 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz range to find the best signal.The GH2430MS's digital answering system records up to 14 minutes of messages without tapes or extra phone charges. It can be operated remotely over the phone using voice prompts, and comes with a time/day stamp to tell you exactly when a call has come in. A two-digit LED display on the phone's base tells you how many messages are waiting. It also has power-failure protection and allows you to record memos.Caller-ID capability is an added convenience, allowing you to view caller information on a three-line LCD display on the phone handset when you pay for caller-ID service from your phone company. When a call comes in, you can see the caller's name, date, and time on the display before you pick up the phone.The GH2430MS also has call-waiting/caller ID capability, allowing you to view information on an incoming call as you talk on the phone. Its caller-ID memory holds up to 50 names and numbers, and other features include scroll/erase, repeat-call indicator, and total call counter.Other useful phone features include a 20-number memory for frequently dialed numbers and last-number redial. It has a 2.5-millimeter jack for use with an optional headset. It is also compatible with hearing aids, and can be mounted on a desk or wall.The Southwestern Bell GH2430MS brings together advanced technology, a digital answering system, and caller-ID/call-waiting capability in a stylish, modern package. This affordable phone will help you get the most out of cordless technology in your home."

6844,Office Products,Panasonic KXTC1701 900 MHz Cordless Phone with Caller ID (Black),"Carry the convenience of caller ID, call waiting ID, and instant voice  mail access with you in the handset of a 900 MHz cordless phone. The Panasonic  KX-TC1701 offers timesaving features in a compact package for your home or  office.A lighted, three-line display window on the back of the KX-TC1701's  handset back shows callers' names and phone numbers, including area code, giving  you choice and security when taking incoming calls. If you are already on a call  when another comes in, the KX-TC1701 displays the waiting caller's ID  information in the window. The caller ID memory stores up to 50 phone numbers;  you can scroll through them using up/down search buttons, edit them, and call  back a stored number with a one-button command.The handset back also includes  a voice mail indicator light that flashes when new messages are waiting on your  voice mail service (an optional service from your phone company). You can access  your voice mail instantly with a one-button voice mail command that is located  just below the handset keypad.We tested the KX-TC1701's cordless performance  in our usual testing environment and found it satisfactory, though less  desirable than some similar 900 MHz phones. The signal was strong until the  handset was about 60 feet from the base; at this point, the signal became  distorted. The sound quality, using Panasonic's Sound Charge Plus technology,  was superior to most cordless phones, however.Panasonic's Ultra Charge  capability lets you complete the KX-TC1701's initial battery-pack charge in just  four hours. The battery charge lasts for nearly eight hours of talk time or for  up to 21 days of standby. Other features of this phone include last-number  redial, memory dialing, and one-button direct dial commands. For convenience,  the handset volume and the ringer volume commands are easily accessible, located  just below the handset keypad. The handset locator/pager, unlike some other  phones we've tested, does produce a beep loud enough to be heard above other  household or office noises.Overall, we think the Panasonic KX-TC1701 provides  satisfactory cordless performance while delivering features that are desirable  for any busy home or office phone.--Bryan TaulbeePros:Lighted display window in the handset backEditable 50-number caller ID memoryClear signal qualityCons:Limited operating range"

The 1.3 megapixel camera lens is housed above this display. Up/down buttons are placed on the left side for volume control. Most of the phone's features and on-screen menus are controlled by a five-way center button on the handset's backlit control pad, which is precision cut from a single sheet of nickel-plated copper alloy. A charging port and USB data cable port is placed on the bottom of the phone. The RAZR V3c also features 30 MB of embedded memory for storing pictures, videos and downloaded V Cast content. Note that the phone does not have a 2.5mm headset jack.Calling FeaturesThe RAZR V3c's internal phone book can hold up to 1000 contacts while the phone's picture ID system allows you to assign pictures to your most common callers.

A number of ringtones come preloaded on the phone and more ringtones can be downloaded from Verizon Wireless' Get It Now service. For times when you want to be discreet, there's a vibrating alert. A built-in speakerphone makes it easy to talk without having the phone to your ear while voice activated dialing makes calling your friends, family and associates as easy as saying their names. Speaker-independent technology allows any speaker to dial numbers with the voice dialing system. And because the RAZR V3c is Bluetooth enabled, wireless headsets can be configured with the phone for total handsfree operation.Messaging, Internet, and ToolsThe RAZR V3c is a messaging and wireless Internet powerhouse. Support is built in for sending and receiving pictures, text, graphics, sound and video via messages. When used in combination with the phone's built-in still and video camera, MMS opens up a whole new world of messaging fun. There's also a built-in web browser for Verizon Mobile Web downloads and mobile web browsing. Verizon's optional Mobile Web package allows you to read and send e-mails and view your favorite web content on your phone. You can trade stocks online, compare prices while shopping, access flight information, get movie listings and find directions to the theater. iTap text entry, which is a technology that makes it easier for people to enter words and text on handsets, is built into the unit-- a plus for mobile email and text messaging users.With support for the EV-DO high-speed data standard, the RAZR V3c is fully compatible with Verizon's V Cast service. With V Cast, you can download and stream high-quality video. Need news and weather? Get the latest Accuweather forecast delivered right to your handset, or stream CNN news headlines. ESPN sports updates, entertainment news from E!, and even Sesame Street content for the kids, are all available.

8403,Cell Phones & Accessories,Motorola V600 Unlocked Cell Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver),"The tri-band Motorola V600 cell phone features Bluetooth connectivity, an integrated VGA digital camera, and MMS with video clip playback. You'll also get ""Situational Lights""--a feature that lets you light colors for various types of calls--and much more, all displayed on a large, high-resolution 176 x 220 pixels, 65,000 color interior screen.The basic Motorola clamshell format continues to provide a solid and attractive option for any dedicated cell phone user. Its steel frame is compact and attractive, (the faceplate-changing capabilities seem a bit unnecessary) and it's loaded with all the essential features you'll need for power usage plus a few bonuses. You may find the volume a bit high out of the box, and it goes into hibernate almost as fast as you can dial a number, but these are minor, adjustable quibbles on a truly stellar phone.Calling FeaturesSee a detailed view of the phone's features,frontandback.Used simply as a cell phone, the V600 features a five-way navigation key with multiple dedicated function keys for easy menu navigation. Primary calling features include voice dialing, integrated speakerphone, vibrate mode, call timers, redial, missed call indicator, call log, any-key answer, auto-answer, auto-redial, roaming indicator, speed dial, linked (credit card) dialing, phonebook look-up, phonebook scroll, mute control, no-answer transfer, one-touch 911, system select, usage alert, and a phone book of up to 1250 entries, including picture caller ID functionality. When the phone is closed, its external screen (two lines, 96 x 32 pixelss) displays caller ID, date, time, and various status icons, including text message waiting, voice message waiting, battery and signal strength, and voice and message mail. There's even a blue backlight on the secondary display for nighttime viewing.The V600 sports well-placed, well-machined keys, and its compact size does nothing to hinder dialing even for large-fingered users. The solid scroll keys bring you to very intuitive menus presented nicely on a single screen, marked by functional but showier-than-necessary graphics. There are also dedicated external buttons for speaker volume, voice recording, and ring volume.Messaging and InternetThe advanced MMS capabilities built in to the V600 enable users to send, edit, forward, and receive image, text, audio, and video messages over the wireless Internet, to and from compatible phones or PCs. (Messages can run up to 100k in size.) You'll also get instant messaging capability, messaging templates, SMS two-way messaging, conventional email, and predictive text assistance. Beyond messaging, the V600's Internet connectivity lets you access online services such as stock quotes, road directions, airline information, entertainment, and more. You can also download Java applications (version CLDC 1.0, MIDP 2.0, 100k per application limit) for which the phone provides 5 MB total (shared) memory. High-speed data transfer and download round out the package. The V600 supports digital TTY/TDD functionality for the hearing impaired.OrganizerOrganizer features include a calendar, calculator with currency converter, date book with event storage, and voice memo. You can also transfer this data to your PC wirelessly via the phone's Bluetooth capability.We found the V600's appointment scheduling to be right in line with our fairly basic needs. Other than the universal annoyance of pecking out appointment details with the ten-key letter system (there's no QWERTY keyboard here as you'll find on some of the more recent, albeit early-adopter phones) this phone's organizer features provided enough data entry space for any busy person taking these functions seriously, but no more.Fun and GamesFor fun, the V600 sports a built-in 640 x 480 pixels integrated digital camera with zoom and brightness adjustment functions. Pictures taken with the camera can be stored in the phone or sent to others via multimedia messaging. The 5 MB of memory available for storing pictures is also shared with whatever wallpapers, screensavers, ring tones, Java applications, or games you may download from the Internet. The V600 also features 24 chord ring tone capability. Users can assign different tones for different callers in the V600's phonebook, and assign separate tones to denote incoming messages, faxes, and reminders. Wireless multiplayer gaming capabilities and two included games, ""Bejeweled"" and ""Stuntman"", round out the entertainment perks that ship with this phone.ConclusionsWe liked this phone's very basic camera. It was easy to use and worry-free and the device can be accessed instantly from the phone's top level screen menu. From power on, it only took us a moment to take and save a fairly nice picture. However, photo quality is only adequate; about as good as you'd expect for a cell phone circa 2004, as opposed to a dedicated digital camera. We also found the ring tones included with the phone to be generally pleasant, and it was a breeze to assign a custom tone to a number in the phonebook, thanks again to the easy menu system. The included games were basic and fairly fun (at least once). In ""Stuntman"", the phone's vibrate mode provided road rumble as a little car skidded around a bland, full-color stunt course. But player beware! Once the game starts, the volume becomes LOUD and is not apparently adjustable. Finally, there is a nutty little feature called Motomixer, which lets you modify various settings on little songs that you can download, emulating a very rudimentary, miniature studio console.In all, we found the Motorola V600 to be a rock solid, highly effective cell phone with attractive and efficient graphic and audio capabilities. We recommend the V600 without reservations for any serious user.Vital StatisticsThe Motorola V600's security features include call restrictions, phone lock, and new password capability. The phone weighs 4.4 ounces and measures 3.5 x 1.87 x 0.83 inches. Its lithium-ion batteries are rated at up to 450 minutes talk time, and up to 240 hours standby time. It runs on the GSM/GPRS 900/1800/1900 frequencies. In the box, you'll receive the V600, instruction manuals, a high capacity li-ion battery, a headset/earbud, and a battery charger."

12391,Cell Phones & Accessories,Bluetooth RAZRWIRE Oakley Sunglasses - Black,"Imagine yourself by the pool, stretched out on your lounge chair, soaking in the rays. Or in the middle of a great workout on your mountain bike, pounding your way up the trail. Suddenly your cell phone rings. Wouldn't it be great if you didn't have to interrupt your tan or workout to answer it? The Bluetooth RAZRWIRE Oakley Sunglasses, featuring patented Oakley optics with Motorola Bluetooth technology, lets you talk on your phone without having to halt your activities. By combining a wireless headset with premium optics in a cutting-edge integrated design, these sunglasses will keep connected and active--or inactive!--in style.Great for biking ...... hanging out ...... or just looking sharp.Bluetooth RAZRWIRE Oakley Sunglasses keep you connected while looking hip.Design FeaturesThe RAZRWIRE is the first eyewear to combine patented Oakley optics with Motorola wireless Bluetooth technology. This unique integrated design frees you from cumbersome wires and allows you to quickly answer and place calls without having to reach for your cell phone.At the heart of the RAZRWIRE is a pair of premium Oakley sunglasses featuring ultralightweight, fully adjustable frames and Oakley's patented XYZ Optics with Plutonite lenses for improved impact protection and 100% protection from all UV rays. Oakley's proprietary O-luminum frames are 40% lighter than pure titanium and feature custom, adaptable hinges that offer a snug and secure fit. The semi-rimless design means there's no rim to block your downward view--an important feature for working out. The Bluetooth module, which complements the unmistakable Oakley design, can be easily adjusted to provide you with the most comfortable speaking position, and it can be attached to either the left or right frame. Soft unobtainium components increase your grip the more you perspire, which makes the RAZRWIRE ideal for the most extreme lifestyles. And because the RAZRWIRE is completely wireless, you'll never have to worry about hooking things on your ear or accidentally pulling off a headset with a tangled cord. In other words, unlike conventional headsets that force you to remove your sunglasses to use them, the RAZRWIRE is designed precisely to be used as both high-quality eyewear and a premium headset simultaneously.Widely known as one of the premier manufacturer of optical lenses, Oakley has fitted the RAZRWIRE with its high-definition optics and Plutonite lens material that is engineered to stop every wavelength of ultraviolet radiation, not just the lower energy form known as UVA. While most lenses that offer UV protection provide a thin surface coating that can become scratched, leaving your dilated pupils exposed to UV leaks, the RAZRWIRE has protection that's built right into the lens material. This process blocks 100% of all UVA, UVB, and UVC rays, as well as harmful blue light. And unlike conventional eyewear that bends light rays and distorts vision at the lens periphery, Oakley's XYZ Optics maps the full lens contour to the human eye, ensuring razor-sharp vision at all angles, delivering a virtually distortion-free view throughout all surfaces of the wrapped lens contours.The engineering construction of the lens and frame meets all ANSI Z87.1 standards for impact protection. This standard requires that the lens be hit by a 500-gram metal spike (over a pound of weight) dropped from a height of 51.2 inches (over four feet). To pass the test, no frame parts or lens fragments that could damage the eye may be ejected during impact. What this means to you is that whether your activities take you on dirt trails with your bike or on the mountain trails with your backpack, the RAZRWIRE will keep your eyes protected and safe. And when you don't want the Bluetooth module with you, you can easily remove it and use the RAZRWIRE as stand-alone sunglasses.Calling FeaturesThe RAZRWIRE is armed with Motorola's third-generation Bluetooth technology and supports Bluetooth RF protocol 1.1 and 1.2. This means that the headset is compatible with most Bluetooth-enabled cell phones and other Bluetooth devices.The RAZRWIRE features Oakley XYZ optics, Motorola Bluetooth, ultralight frames, and an adjustable design--the perfect headset for any active lifestyle.You'll need a cellular phone that supports the Bluetooth Hands-free profile or Bluetooth Headset profile. (Consult your phone manual or contact your cellular phone dealer for compatibility.) Once you've connected, you can take the RAZRWIRE anywhere. It works up to 33 feet away from your cell phone, giving you the convenience of hands-free communication without the hassle of wires.The headset's intuitive, easy-to-use controls include two volume buttons and a single, multifunction call button that lets you answer, end, hold, and toggle between calls. An imbedded microphone can be adjusted for your convenience. A ring tone in your ear tells you when a call is coming in, so you can turn off your phone ringer and avoid disturbing others. When a call comes in, just press the multifunction button and begin talking. Charging is easy using the included wall charger or through a USB computer port using an optional cable (sold separately). A quick charge of 1.5 hours provides 80% capacity, and a full charge takes only 2.5 hours. You can also purchase an optional car charger, for recharging on the road, or a World Wall Charger with included adapters to recharge in foreign countries (both items sold separately). Bluetooth Sniff Mode technology increases the battery life of the RAZRWIRE, offering continuous talk time of more than five hours and standby time of up to approximately 100 hours.Vital StatisticsThe RAZRWIRE module measures 0.75 by 2.1 by 0.4 inches and weighs 0.5 ounces. It is compatible with Bluetooth 1.2 and is backwards-compatible with Bluetooth 1.1 technology. The headset offers approximately four to six hours of talk time and up to 100 hours of standby time. The unit can be charged via the included wall charger or through an optional USB cable or car charger. A quick charge of 1.5 hours provides 80% capacity, and a full charge takes 2.5 hours.This RAZRWIRE features a pewter/black iridum/black design.

12762,Office Products,Sony SPP-A973 900 MHz Digital Cordless Phone with Answering System,"With the Sony SPP-A973, you get digital 900 MHz operation with extended range; thanks to superior transmission technology, you can carry your cordless phone further and still carry on a conversation. Digital privacy uses higher technology to keep your private conversations private, using sophisticated digital speech encoding between handset and base unit. Digital sound quality uses the technology behind the compact disc to achieve amazing voice accuracy; it sounds less like older cordless phones, more like a corded phone.The 50-number directory dialing gives quick access to a broad range of frequently dialed numbers; for easy reference, each phone number is identified by the person's name. The Jog Dial provides one-finger access to these numbers and to caller ID memories; simply push the button and jog up and down to find the entry you're looking for; push the button again to dial the number.Caller ID with call waiting (20-call memory) allows you to screen the phone number and name of an incoming second call while you talk with the first caller (requires combination of caller ID and call waiting services). A three-line backlit LCD display on the handset offers clear presentation of caller ID information, number dialed, and more. It's even backlit for easy viewing. Memory Match Ringing sounds a distinctive ring if an incoming call matches one of your 50 directory-dial numbers (requires caller ID service from your local phone company).The SPP-A973 has dual-battery capability--the base unit has the built-in battery charger where you can charge an optional battery in the base unit. Even with just one battery pack, you get seven hours of talk time and seven days of standby, which allows for longer conversation and longer intervals between charging batteries.The SPP-A973 includes a tapeless, all-digital answering system that records both your greeting and incoming messages on IC chips; it uses no moving parts, for exceptional reliability; and it can record up to 18 minutes. Incoming messages can be stored in three separate ""message boxes"" so that each co-worker or family member can access his or her messages separately. The voice time-and-day stamp records the time of each call after each message. Adjustable rings allow you to decide how many times the phone will ring before it answers. Permanent flash memory protects your recorded messages even in the event of a power outage; it requires no battery backup. Call screening lets you identify callers on the base before picking up. A voice-guided system leads you through the setup and operation of the unit. A prerecorded greeting will answer calls if you choose not to record your own greeting. An audible message indicator beeps when messages are waiting (on/off switchable). Announce-only mode answers calls without taking messages."

14988,Cell Phones & Accessories,Nokia 5180i TracFone Prepaid Cell Phone with 10 FREE MINUTES,"The Nokia 5180i is a handset offered by TracFone, a leading national prepaid service provider. The 5180i, matched  with TracFone's simple and hassle-free service, is a convenient way to own a cell phone without contracts, credit checks,  security deposits, monthly bills, or age restrictions.The 5180i is a lightweight personal phone with impressive talk and standby time that's loaded with classic, simple-to-learn features. Its changeable  faceplates, 30 different ringers (and room for 5 downloadable tones), and an expansive world of accessories, makes the  5180 a fun, general-purpose phone. And with predictive T9 text input, wireless business card and e-mail capabilities,  Nokia has created a more competent business communications tool (although they have yet to introduce a Web-enabled phone).Weighing in at 6.2 ounces (including battery), the 5180i measures 5.2 inches high, 1.85 inches wide, and 1.2 inches deep,  not counting a stubby antenna that extends another 0.7 inches. As a moderate-weight, midsize phone, the 5180 is highly  portable. It's also extremely rugged in typical mobile phone environments--including being thrown into bags and cases and  occasionally dropped on the ground.Four buttons handle most of the menu navigation: a hefty button in the middle that Nokia calls the Navi key, up and down  arrow buttons that control volume during calls, and a key marked ""C"" for ""clear."" Menu navigation is very intuitive. If  you tap the Navi key, the first of a series of graphical menu items pops up. Hit the Navi key again to drill down to  options within the menu or tap the up or down arrow keys to choose a different menu. The top-level menu choices are phone  book, messages (SMSand voice mail alerts), call log, settings (for calls, phone, and security), system, games (Memory,  Snake, and Logic), clock, tones, and keypad lock. The brightly backlit display works well with the control keys to  simplify finding and making choices. In text mode, five 16-character lines are displayed.If you like distinctive ringing tones, you'll be satiated with the 5180, which lets you select from 30 preprogrammed  tones. You can also download an additional five ringer tones from your service provider's website, if applicable. And  while there's no internal vibration mode, an optional vibrating battery is available. You also can store electronic  business cards in your phone book. Any friend or associate can forward their name, number and e-mail to your phone, and  you can automatically store their information with some deft menu navigation.One caveat worth mentioning: Not all faceplates work with the 5180i phone. Nokia-brand faceplates will work, but faceplates  from other manufacturers will not fit the 5180i. Although this is a 5100-series phone, the keypad is a unique size, and it  does not accommodate other manufacturer's faceplates.The Nokia 5180i has the usual array of standard call and messaging features. If supported by your carrier, you can use this  phone with caller ID, call waiting, call forwarding, and voice mail alerts. A call history maintains the last 10 dialed  numbers, 10 most recently received calls, and 10 missed calls. The phone supportstwo-way SMS text messaging, but is not  WAP- or Internet-enabled.The 5180i offers four basic security features: An initial security code, keypad lock,call-restrictionmodes, and a lock  code that can activate or deactivate memory and menu options. One nice thing about the lock-code feature is you can store  numbers in a secret unlocked location, which will allow you to make calls even if the phone is locked.The 5180i'sNiMH batteryis rated to last up to 180 minutes of digitaltalk timeand 200 hours of digitalstandby time. In  our testing, we achieved 180 minutes of digitaltalk timeand over 225 hours of digitalstandby time.Overall, Nokia's 5180i is a noteworthy addition to their 5100-series phones. Choose your favorite faceplate color and  ringer tone and shock the world!--Brown Consulting AssociatesPros:Airtime balance displayInexpensive prepaid optionEasy activationCons:Lacks standard vibration modeHow We Tested Battery-Talk/Standby TimeWhen reading our reviews, you should view the test results of mobile-phone battery talk time and standby time as relative information only. Many variables, including carrier signal strength at your location, signal consistency (including incoming and outgoing calls), display and ringer settings, and battery charging methods and history, will affect performance. When handset manufacturers and mobile phone carriers list talk-time and standby-time ratings, they usually include disclaimers about variable performance and often refer to the times they publish as maximum times. Some quote expected battery life ranges, and in this case you're probably safe to assume you'll experience at least the minimum rated range. Note that manufacturers of dual-mode digital and analog handsets publish battery-life rates for both digital and analog modes, as analog mode consumes much more power than digital mode.Our Tests:We tested digital-mode talk and standby times with each phone. Prior to each test, we fully charged the phone's battery according to the manufacturer's directions. To test digital-phone talk time, we turned the phone on, established a digital carrier signal, dialed a number in our test lab, and, when the call rang through, took the receiving phone's handset off the hook. When all went well, we didn't do anything else except record the time when the phone died. In a couple of cases, the phones lost the signal and dropped the calls. If we were right there and could redial, we did so immediately and continued running the test. Otherwise, we halted the test, recharged the battery, and started the test over. Assuming consistent carrier-signal strength, this test should represent best-case talk time. And it's worth noting that several phones' talk-time performance significantly exceeded the manufacturers' ratings.To test digital-phone standby time, we turned the phone on, established a carrier signal, and left the phone in standby mode. We checked the phone every few hours (for what was often days on end) until the phone finally cut out. Since no outgoing or incoming calls occurred during testing and because the phone was not moved, this method should represent best-case standby time, again assuming consistent carrier signal strength."

No, where the difference is in being 'USB Power Port Ready' or not. For example, many manufactures use special wall chargers where each manufacture has their own special wiring specification inside the wall charger to put their device into proper 'charge mode'. Without this proper wiring yuor the mobile device will not charge using a USB cable. For example a common misunderstood connector used by manufactures are micro & mini USB type connectors. These physically look the same but required different wiring to properly put mobile devices into the proper charge mode. At Gomadic we put this special wiring in the cable hence why title says this retractable USB cable will charger but will not offer USB data transfer. Most people are not using the USB cable for data transfer we decided to convert this product line into a USB charge *only* cable. In the case of the Samsung SCH-A950 you might have gotten away with using a USB data cable in the past but to ensure you don't get stranded when you need a charge most we have integrated the wiring in the connector end that plugs into your Samsung SCH-A950 to ensure no mater what type of USB power port you use your device will charge, guaranteed or your money back!

Say goodbye to static-filled conversations and dropped words with this high-powered phone with a sleek, modern look.This GE cordless phone takes advantage of the higher-frequency 2.4 GHz range of the FM radio spectrum, opened to cordless phones only in 1998. A 2.4 GHz cordless phone like the GE 27700GE2 is basically an FM transmitter/receiver that uses shorter wavelengths so radio waves encounter less interference. The 2.4 GHz range is also far above the range accessible to most scanners, so there's less risk of eavesdropping.When you add digital spread-spectrum technology to a 2.4 GHz cordless, you get the best security and clarity currently available. Based in part on a concept invented by 1940s screen actress Hedy Lamarr, spread spectrum transmission switches rapidly from frequency to frequency at random. A DSS signal needs less power and encounters less interference.The GE 27700GE2 automatically switches between 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz range to find the best signal, while the Secure Voice scrambler adds another layer of security by encrypting the phone signal. It also includes an easy-to-use 20-number memory and a page/locator feature that enables you to find the handset when you've misplaced it.The backlit keypad makes it easy to dial a number in the dark, and handset volume control allows you to adjust the volume as you talk. Indicators on the front of the phone's base light up when you have a voice-mail message waiting, when the phone is charging, or it is in use elsewhere in the house.With the latest technology, advanced phone features and an affordable price, the GE 27700GE2 can't be beat as an introduction to 2.4 GHz DSS cordless power."

You can see the electronic components through the plastic case, and bright red LEDs flash when the phone rings and when you return the handset to the base. In addition to its fun exterior, this phone has some serious features--its 900 MHz frequency offers improved range and clarity over older phones operating on lower frequency bands.To set up the phone, we inserted the battery pack, plugged in the AC power, and connected the RJ-11 telephone line cord. We recommend that you charge the battery overnight before using the phone for the first time.In our tests of the VT02-9111, we placed the base unit in a typical area, where walls, floors, and obstructions might interfere with signal quality. We made a variety of local and long-distance calls; its connection sounded almost as good as a corded phone's, with only occasional, minor static. We could hear the onset of fuzzy reception when we held the handset about 50 feet from the base. Interference became intrusive at about 100 feet, but the handset continued to function until about 530 feet, where it lost contact with the base. The battery is rated to last for seven hours of talk time, but in our test, the phone started beeping (indicating a low battery) after only one hour.Within a reasonable proximity to the base, the VTech sounds clear, but the real draw of this phone is its bold fashion statement.Pros:Attractive, fun style900 MHz operation for better sound and rangeCons:Short battery life"

TheVonageDigitalVoice Service package contains everything you need to quickly and easily install a phone line in your home. In a matter of minutes, your Vonage DigitalVoice phone can be up and running, and you can be talking over your broadband connection to your friends, business associates, and faraway relatives. It's easy: just plug the included phone adapter into your high-speed Internet connection and plug your telephone into the included Motorola VT1005v dual-port voice terminal adapter.Enjoy the conveniences of standard telephone service with none of the hassles. With Vonage DigitalVoice, you can talk all you want to anyone in the country for one flat monthly subscription fee. Plus, you can make international calls at a low per-minute rate. Another bonus is that a U.S. call to Canada is treated like a domestic long-distance call, rather than an international one. Vonage also supports short-form emergency 911 services, where available. (Dialing 911 requires activation and operates differently than traditional 911. See Vonage's website for details.)Unlike other Internet telephone service providers, Vonage does not require access numbers, account numbers, or PINs to make a simple phone call. Instead, you just dial your party's phone number on an ordinary telephone keypad. Switching your current local phone service to Vonage is a snap. You can even choose any area code you want, subject to availability.Motorola's VT1005v dual-port voice terminal adapter and router fully supports Vonage's VoIP service (voice over Internet Protocol) and lets you connect up to two phones. The adapter works by converting your voice from analog to digital, which is then recognized as data and transmitted over the Internet. The VT1005v will work with any cable or DSL modem and operates seamlessly with any PC, Mac, or UNIX-based computer, so you can talk and surf at the same time.What's in the BoxMotorola VT1005v Voice Terminal Adapter, AC power adapter and line cord, Ethernet cable, VT1000v series Voice Terminal CD-ROM; Vonage DigitalVoice plan, support information, and promotional offers.But How Does It Work?Use Vonage like you use any telephoneWith Vonage, you pick up the phone, listen for the dial tone, and dial the number of your choice. There are no extra numbers to dial and no special routines to follow. It's that simple. You don't have to be an engineer to use the service and can be up and running within minutes of receiving your Vonage package. They send you everything you need to get Vonage phone service, right down to the extra cable wire. Best of all, there's no technician, no wiring in the walls, and no technical experience needed! Setup usually takes less than 5 minutes.Easy installationPlug the analog-to-digital phone adapter Vonage sends you for free into your high-speed Internet connection. Then take any standard telephone and plug it into the phone adapter.Surfing the WebIf you'd like to surf the Web and use your Vonage service at the same time, the phone adapter can share your Internet connection with your computer. Talk on the phone and surf the Net with ease. (Depending on your home network setup, this may require additional equipment.)How this lets your call travelVonage works just like the telephone you have in your home today. You pick up the phone, dial the number, and it connects to wherever you're calling.  In more technical terms, Vonage uses the phone adapter they send you for free to convert your voice from an analog signal to a digital signal. The digital signal then can be sent over your high-speed Internet connection because it is recognized as data. When someone calls you, they dial your number. Behind the scenes, your number looks very much like an e-mail address. This number instructs the call to travel over the Internet and through Vonage's network to the phone adapter, your phone rings, and all you have to do is pick up and answer it.Visit www.vonage.com/amazon to see which plan is best suited to your lifestyle and budget."

28639,Office Products,VTech 9111 900 MHz Cordless Phone (Green),"Add a burst of color to your desk with this translucent green cordless phone from VTech. You can see the electronic components through the plastic case, and bright red LEDs flash when the phone rings and when you return the handset to the base. In addition to its fun exterior, this phone has some serious features--its 900 MHz frequency offers improved range and clarity over older phones operating on lower frequency bands.To set up the phone, we inserted the battery pack, plugged in the AC power, and connected the RJ-11 telephone line cord. We recommend that you charge the battery overnight before using the phone for the first time.In our tests of the VT02-9111, we placed the base unit in a typical area, where walls, floors, and obstructions might interfere with signal quality. We made a variety of local and long-distance calls; its connection sounded almost as good as a corded phone's, with only occasional, minor static. We could hear the onset of fuzzy reception when we held the handset about 50 feet from the base. Interference became intrusive at about 100 feet, but the handset continued to function until about 530 feet, where it lost contact with the base. The battery is rated to last for seven hours of talk time, but in our test, the phone started beeping (indicating a low battery) after only one hour.Within a reasonable proximity to the base, the VTech sounds clear, but the real draw of this phone is its bold fashion statement.Pros:Attractive, fun style900 MHz operation for better sound and rangeCons:Short battery life"

The quick reference card also reviews general phone operations, and setting up and using caller ID. The larger owner's manual describes memory dialing, 50-number caller ID memory, page/find, and other features. We found the documentation complete and easy to follow, and the phone's LCD display is very descriptive with status information.You control the EXS 9960 with 23 buttons and one switch on the handset. The buttons are comfortable to the touch and easy to read with the handy backlight. The handset is lightweight but still feels sturdy, and the phone's overall construction seems solid.In our tests of the EXS 9960, the handset's sound was mostly flawless indoors, with only minor interference from a notebook computer. Sound remained clear outdoors, with static onset occurring at about 80 feet from the base. The signal began breaking up at about 130 feet and became significantly choppy at about 480 feet; it became inaudible at about 740 feet. The out-of-range indicator sounded at about 800 feet, and the handset resumed operation when we returned to within 740 feet. This performance is typical for good-quality 900 MHz digital sound spectrum (DSS) phones.With its handset about 10 feet from the base, we compared the EXS 9960 to our reference corded desk phone for sound quality. In our listening tests, we could not distinguish one phone from the other. This is excellent performance and compares favorably even to expensive cordless phones.We appreciate the straightforward, sturdy design of the EXS 9960 along with its good range and excellent sound quality. If you're looking for a 900 MHz DSS phone with caller ID, they don't come much better than this one.--Mike BrownPros:Sturdy constructionLong rangeExcellent sound quality"

With this unit, you have to remove the handset from the cradle in order to use the headset. Pressing a line button activates the speakerphone.However, what's lost in simplicity is gained in finer control over both incoming and outgoing audio levels. The volume control on the front of the amplifier controls the incoming volume--that is, what you hear in your ear. On the side of the unit is a slide that controls outgoing volume--what others hear on the line. However, to move this volume slide, you'll need to use a plastic ""screwdriver"" located on the bottom of the unit.The H51-M12 is not for use with cordless phones or units in which the dial pad is located on the handset. For a typical office phone, however, this unit is worth serious consideration.--John Frederick MoorePros:Flexible incoming and outgoing volume levelsGood sound qualityCons:Requires lifting the phone's handset"

It also saves up to 50 incoming calls for easy retrieval and direct callback.A four-line backlit LCD shows call status, programming options, directory items, and up to three lines of caller ID information, so there's no need for scrolling. Backlighting greatly aids visibility especially in low light areas.With four-way conferencing you can conference in one outside line on up to four other handsets simultaneously. Use the intercom function to listen to what's going on in any room that has a handset, and from the base unit or a handset, you can call any other extension in the system.Personalize your ring tone with any of six selectable rings to alert you when there is an incoming call. Using the provided headset jack and belt clip, you can also connect an optional headset to the standard 2.5 mm jack for hands-free conversations."

The phone is also  stylish and sturdy with a base that can be wall-mounted or placed on any flat  surface.The SPP-SS965 includes a keypad on the base for quick dialing with  the speakerphone. You can place and answer calls from the base even if you can't  find the handset. If you need to locate the handset, however, the intercom  button on the base pages the handset with a continuous ring, making it easy to  find.The SPP-SS965 displays caller ID information on both the base and the  handset, so you'll always know who's calling before you answer. The caller ID  memory can store up to 20 names and phone numbers. With the jog dial feature,  you can browse through the list of callers in the caller ID log, or you can  access up to 50 speed-dial numbers in the phone's directory. The jog dial is a  small wheel on the side of the handset, and in our tests, all of its functions  were intuitive and easy to learn. For faster dialing, there are three one-touch  presets, perfect for emergency phone numbers. The Sony SPP-SS965 also has a two- way intercom that allows you to talk between the handset and the base--great for  communicating with family members who may wander off with the phone.In our  tests, the SPP-SS965 sounded very good. Although its digital spread spectrum  technology provides a longer range and better sound quality than other types of  900 MHz cordless phones, we were disappointed that the handset maintained its  best quality only within about 40 feet. Overall, however, this high-performance  device from Sony has a wealth of features that will simplify your life.-- Megan DuganPros:Clear signal with minimal interferenceHandy jog dial for one-finger access to numbers stored in memory or the  Caller ID boxStores up to 50 frequently dialed numbersCons:Caller ID display is constantly illuminatedBest sound quality only within 40 feet of the base"

42747,Cell Phones & Accessories,Motorola i95cl Phone (Nextel),"Based on Motorola&#x92;s i90c phone, the i95cl offers some valuable upgrades that increase the functionality of the phone significantly. The new highlights include a full-color display with an eight-line screen, plus more memory to handle Java programs.The phone is quite sturdy, but it sacrifices compactness for rugged design. Since it&#x92;s too big to fit in most pockets, the i95cl has a belt clip, but at almost 5 ounces it can weigh your belt down a bit. The retractable antenna has a durable feel, and the rubberized volume control and push-to-talk buttons on the side and speaker buttons on top are unlikely to break if the phone is dropped. Buttons on the i95cl&#x92;s interior are fairly flat but are spread apart so misdialing is not an issue. An LCD screen on the outside of the flip top is helpful for quickly checking time and date or for screening callers.The phone was slow to power up (about 40 seconds), but considering the rich graphics, that&#x92;s to be expected. Upon start-up, the i95cl put us immediately into the message center. We had no text messages, but a voice mail from a colleague sounded crisp and clear. From the main menu, we easily accessed all of our settings without referring to the manual. The long eight-line, high-contrast screen with a large text and mellow, white backlighting made it easy to read our options from several feet away.We set our background display to the American flag, (which looked impressive on the color screen), personalized our keys, and adjusted the ring. The i95cl has nine selectable ring styles&#x97;the usual tinny electronic-sounding rings--and 10 polyphonic musical files to choose from that sound almost orchestral compared to ring choices on most cell phones. After enjoying Pachebel&#x92;s Canon in D Major and Tchaikovsky&#x92;s ""Waltz of the Flowers,"" we eventually settled on the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" for our ring.The phone book holds multiple numbers for each person, and we had no problem entering a few friends. We set up voice-activated dialing for a few numbers as well, but found that giving a command with even a slight change in tone from the original voice recording caused the i95cl to reject our dialing request.The i95cl&#x92;s Internet connection is one of the faster ones we&#x92;ve experienced, and Motorola has bumped up the memory and improved the processor and connectivity speed in this model. In addition to preset weather, financial, and shopping links, the phone lets users do Internet searches and send and receive two-way messages and e-mail (including instant messages with AIM).The Java apps feature combined with the rich color screen was amazing to behold. Preinstalled apps include a calculator and two fairly sophisticated games. We found that Tiger Woods PGA Tour Wireless Golf has great graphics but is fairly slow and easy to win. The action-packed MotoGP motocross racing game played so well it felt almost like we were on a GameBoy. Subscribers to Nextel Wireless Web service can download additional Java applications from Nextel&#x92;s Web site or install custom apps from the Internet.Motorola has increased the memory in the i95cl (since the release of its predecessor, the i90c) to handle robust Java applications&#x97;and it is a significant improvement. However, users still won&#x92;t be able to pack a whole lot of apps in there if they want to download a bunch of animated 3-D games. Each of the preexisting games takes up about 700-800 KB of data space and our phone comes with 1,479 KB of free space for new applications. That leaves room for only two additional games or several other business applications. In addition, Java apps share memory space with ring styles, wallpaper images, and voice records, so once users run out of space, they&#x92;ll have to start deleting some of these files. Still, this is a fairly recent breakthrough in cellular technology and the fact that Java apps can be stored at all is remarkable.The i95cl also has the ability to function as a walkie-talkie, through a technology that Motorola and Nextel have been offering for years. Using Nextel Direct Connect, users can communicate with one person or a group via two-way radio. A PTT (push-to-talk) button on the left side of the phone, below the volume buttons, lets users talk without opening the phone or even removing the phone from their belt loop. The best part is that users don&#x92;t pay for minutes using the radio.Overall, the slick features and conveniences on this phone far outweigh the issues with the bulky design. The multitude of communication options make the i95cl an ideal phone for business users who are communicating with employees both on site and long distance.--Cristina VaamondePros:Supports Java applications, including 3-D gamesLarge full-color display with high-contrast screenMore memory and faster processor than its predecessor (Motorola i90c)Fast Internet connectivityDoubles as two-way radio without using minutesCons:Bulky designVoice-activated dialing doesn&#x92;t always recognize commandsJava apps share memory space with ring styles, wallpaper images, and voice recordsHow We Tested Battery Talk/Standby TimeWhen reading our reviews, you should view the test results of mobile-phone  battery talk time and standby time as relative information only. Many variables,  including carrier signal strength at your location, signal consistency  (including incoming and outgoing calls), display and ringer settings, and  battery charging methods and history, will affect performance. When handset  manufacturers and mobile phone carriers list talk-time and standby-time ratings,  they usually include disclaimers about variable performance and often refer to  the times they publish as maximum times. Some quote expected battery life  ranges, and in this case you're probably safe to assume you'll experience at  least the minimum rated range. Note that manufacturers of dual-mode digital and  analog handsets publish battery-life rates for both digital and analog modes, as  analog mode consumes much more power than digital mode.Our Tests:We tested digital-mode talk and standby times with each phone.  Prior to each test, we fully charged the phone's battery according to the  manufacturer's directions. To test digital-phone talk time, we turned the phone  on, established a digital carrier signal, dialed a number in our test lab, and,  when the call rang through, took the receiving phone's handset off the hook.  When all went well, we didn't do anything else except record the time when the  phone died. In a couple of cases, the phones lost the signal and dropped the  calls. If we were right there and could redial, we did so immediately and  continued running the test. Otherwise, we halted the test, recharged the  battery, and started the test over. Assuming consistent carrier-signal strength,  this test should represent best-case talk time. And it's worth noting that  several phones' talk-time performance significantly exceeded the manufacturers'  ratings.To test digital-phone standby time, we turned the phone on, established a  carrier signal, and left the phone in standby mode. We checked the phone every  few hours (for what was often days on end) until the phone finally cut out.  Since no outgoing or incoming calls occurred during testing and because the  phone was not moved, this method should represent best-case standby time, again  assuming consistent carrier signal strength."

If your phone supports it, you can also use the BT110 to place voice activated calls. A yellow LED on the unit indicates Bluetooth link activity, the headset's pairing mode and low battery life. And speaking of battery life, the BT110 boasts 15 hours of talk time on a single, easy-to-replace AA battery. There's no need to worry about turning it off, either -- its automatic 'power down' function does it for you.Of course, no headset is any good if it isn't comfortable. The BT110 has you covered there, too. A contoured ear-hook gives the headset a secure behind-the-ear fit (on either ear). Meanwhile, a patented in-ear MiniGel offers comfortable listening so you can really enjoy your calls -- no more holding the phone to your ear. The lightweight, durable design is neat and functional and, once on, it stays securely in place -- you'll forget you're even wearing it."

45690,Office Products,"Brother FAX-560 Personal Plain Paper Fax, Phone, and Copier","The Brother PPF560 provides several services, combining a plain-paper  personal fax machine with telephone and copy functions. It sports a compact  design with bold, clearly marked operating features and is equipped with a  convenient telephone handset. It also has a 50-page standard paper cassette  tray. Additional advantages include the copy function, which lets you make up to  99 copies at a time, and the 50-number memory for automatic dialing.We set up the Brother PPF560 in minutes without reference to the owner's manual,  thanks to a simple design and intuitive operation. Still, to get the benefits of  extensive features, we recommend following Brother's well-detailed instructions  for programming in its thorough manual. You'll also need that information to  remotely retrieve messages, pages, and faxes. We also recommend perusal of the  guide for setting up the fax unit on lines with an external answering machine or  with numbers that roll over. Note that phone lines using call waiting or voice  mail may run into trouble operating this fax unit.The handset is very lightweight and tapered, and the automatic fax-phone switch  lets you make calls and receive faxes through the same phone line. The fax unit  lets you know when you have a voice call by emitting double rings. The receiver  delivers clear, clean sound. The unit supports caller ID and distinctive ring  (when you subscribe through your phone service provider). The automatic document  feeder can accommodate 10 pages at a time. The 16-digit LCD displays clear,  bright numbers and messages. The ring volume is adjustable from mute to loud,  which is fortunate, because the PPF560 has a jarring tone. The phone index for  alphabetical search of stored numbers is a great convenience, as is the  automatic redial, delayed transmission and hold buttons. Making copies takes the  click of one button; enlargements and reductions must be keyed in. The Brother  PPF560 is supported by a 90-day warranty.--Barbara PricePros:Remote access to faxes and messagesUnique ring identifies incoming voice callsCopier capabilitiesCons:May conflict with some phone servicesSome functions take several steps to programYou can make up to 99 copies but the unit holds only 50 sheets"

Built-in safeguards prevent you from interrupting the modem, even if you pick up the phone and try to make a call. You can, of course, override the safeguard to make a call. The CP-720 also indicates if the line is in use by another caller on an extension.The CP-720 delivers the extended operating range expected of a 900 MHz phone. We tested this phone in a building with plenty of walls and electronic equipment; the signal remained strong at approximately 75 feet from the base, but quickly faded at greater distances. The sound quality was acceptable, though not as clear as some comparable 900 MHz phones. We also tested the battery and the CP-720 successfully delivered the four promised hours of talk time.After one quick consultation with the instruction manual, programming speed-dial numbers was quick and easy. Additional features include call hold, call flash, last-number redial, handset pager, out-of-range alarm, and channel selection.Uncommon features add to the CP-720's appeal and practicality. The handset keypad illuminates in low-light situations and you can extend the battery's standby charge for up to 20 days by turning on the power saver feature. You can take a call off hold by picking up any extension on the same phone line.Pros:Modem/phone line monitorIlluminated handset keypadEasy setup and programmingCons:Only 1 ringer-style option"

You'll know you're set once you hear the silly jingle--that's the sign that the system's self-test is being completed.The phone has three built-in microphones and a central speaker. There are jacks for two additional external microphones (not included), which may be needed if your room is larger than the suggested size or has an unusual shape. In our tests, both internal and external microphones performed well, supplying clear sound as long as we maintained our distance and kept our voices fairly well modulated. Leaning too close caused some annoying echoes, but the optimal distance will be slightly different for each person. We heard our callers loudly and clearly, experiencing no problems with choppy sentences (clipping) or one-way communication.The keypad includes redial, mute, and flash buttons. Volume buttons control both ringer and voice, and offer a wide range of comfortable adjustments. With analog systems, the keypad dials outside lines directly, but with digital systems, you must use the keypad on a connected digital phone.While the overall clarity was not exceptional, the Voice Center offers an excellent value for budget-conscious teleconferencers.--Jill LightnerPros:Affordable option for teleconferencingWell-designed user's manual makes setup and operation straightforwardCons:Requires adapter to work with digital phone systemsCords a bit awkward"

The PCT Bypass Amplifier give you all of the great benefits of the MA2-8P amplifier and more. If you don't need the bypass feature, the amplifier work exactly like the MA2-8P regardless and give you worry free operation that PCT is known for providing.
